S'By Robbie Ward TUPELO, Mississippi (Reuters) - A Mississippi martial arts instructor was charged on Saturday with attempting to use a biological weapon after a ricin-laced letter was sent to President Barack Obama earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice said. Everett Dutschke , 41, was arrested at his Tupelo home shortly after midnight by FBI agents following searches of the residence and a former business as part of the ricin letter investigation. He was later charged with "developing ... and possessing" ricin and "attempting" to use it "as a weapon," according to a joint statement by the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Mississippi and the head of the FBI\'s Mississippi office. Ricin is a highly lethal poison made from castor beans. If convicted, Dutschke faces maximum possible penalties of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. His arrest came several days after U.S. prosecutors dropped charges in the case on Tuesday against another Mississippi man, Kevin Curtis , who was released from jail after a search of his home revealed no incriminating evidence. Dutschke\'s name first surfaced when Curtis\' attorney suggested in a court hearing that her client had been framed by someone, and mentioned a running feud between Dutschke and Curtis. Saturday\'s announcement did not specify if Dutschke was being charged in relation to the ricin letters, but it noted that the investigation had been conducted by several federal agencies including the U. S. Postal Inspection Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, did not return calls seeking comment, but she told Reuters earlier in the week that her client denied having anything to do with the ricin letters. Dutschke is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday. Federal agents initially targeted Curtis, an Elvis impersonator, in their efforts to find who sent the letters laced with ricin. Letters addressed to Obama and Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, were retrieved last week at off-site mail facilities before reaching their intended victims. A Mississippi state judge also received a ricin-laced letter. Discovery of the letters fueled more national anxiety in the days after the bombing at the Boston Marathon. The case also brought extra scrutiny for the FBI almost 12 years after a 2001 letter-borne anthrax attack that killed five people and puzzled investigators for years. The anthrax investigation came in the wake of the September 11, 2001, hijacked plane attacks on the United States. Federal agents in unmarked vehicles were stationed in streets surrounding Dutschke\'s home on Friday afternoon and all evening. Agents from the FBI and members of an anti-terrorist response team from the Mississippi National Guard, some wearing hazardous material suits, had searched the home on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as the premises of a former martial arts studio Dutschke ran in the city. Dutschke was cooperating with federal officials during the searches this week, his attorney said. \'MISSING PIECES\' Suspicion had originally fallen on Curtis because of wording contained in all three ricin letters, which included his initials "KC." Dutschke has told local media that he knew Curtis but had only had contact with him three times, and not since 2010. Curtis, 45, told the Northeastern Mississippi Daily Journal that he believed Dutschke deliberately sabotaged his career as a performer by calling sponsors and telling them about Curtis\' numerous prior arrests. "I lost 12 really big shows in 2011 and eight in 2012 directly linked to him," Curtis told the newspaper. Dutschke, who fronted a two-man blues band in Tupelo called RoboDrum, ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate in 2007 against Stephen Holland, a Democratic state representative from the Tupelo area. Holland\'s mother, Sadie, is the judge to whom one of the ricin-tainted letters was mailed this month. Curtis\'s brother and fellow Elvis impersonator, insurance agent Jack Curtis , worked for a time with Dutschke and said he believed the feud with Dutschke was related to his brother\'s efforts to publicize allegations about a black market for body parts at a local Mississippi hospital. Kevin Curtis was fired as a janitor from North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo after raising questions about body parts he said he observed there. The hospital strongly denied the allegations. Dutschke faces other charges related to an April 1 indictment for fondling three children between ages 7 and 16, from 2007 to 2013, according to court records. RICIN POTENCY The FBI said on Thursday that more tests may be necessary to determine the potency of a granular material identified as ricin contained in the letters. An FBI agent testified in court in Mississippi that the ricin found in the letters was in a crude form and looked like castor beans ground up in a blender, according to media accounts. Experts have said ricin in that form would have a low potency. Castor bean plants are grown as ornamental shrubs in the Southern United States, but there is no domestic castor oil production and it is mostly imported from India and China. Milton Leitenberg, senior research scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at the University of Maryland, said the vast majority of ricin cases since the 1960s had involved crude ricin preparations made from recipes published in manuals and on the Internet. "You could ingest this crude stuff, swallow a couple of tablespoons and you\'d probably vomit, but not much more," Leitenberg said in a telephone interview. A material like that described in the ricin court hearing would pose little danger, Leitenberg said. (Additional reporting by Emily Lane in Jackson, Mississippi, Marilyn W.

S'A former taekwondo instructor was taken into custody early Saturday by federal authorities in Mississippi, accused of mailing letters containing the poison ricin to the president, a United States senator and a local judge. The arrest of J. Everett Dutschke, 41, of Tupelo is the second in two weeks in connection with the case. An earlier suspect, an Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis, of Corinth, Miss., was released after no evidence was found linking him to the letters. Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer had said during a hearing in federal court that Mr. Dutschke appeared to have framed Mr. Curtis. Deborah Madden, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Jackson, said Mr. Dutschke was arrested at home shortly before 1 a.m. A law enforcement official in Tupelo said his arrest was uneventful. \xe2\x80\x9cHe walked out, and they took him into custody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sgt. James Hood of the Tupelo Police Department. \xe2\x80\x9cNo problem or anything.\xe2\x80\x9d A lawyer for Mr. Dutschke did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Saturday. Mr. Dutschke has been charged with \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping, producing, stockpiling, transferring, acquiring, retaining and possessing a biological agent\xe2\x80\x9d for use as a weapon. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Oxford on Monday. The arrest is the latest chapter in a bizarre case that began during the tense week of the Boston Marathon bombing. The authorities announced that letters addressed to President Obama and Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, had been found to contain a \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious granular substance,\xe2\x80\x9d which was later determined to be ricin, a deadly poison. A similar letter with the substance was also sent to Judge Sadie Holland of Lee County Justice Court. The letters spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cMissing Pieces\xe2\x80\x9d and were signed \xe2\x80\x9cI am KC and I approve this message,\xe2\x80\x9d both standard parts of e-mail messages sent to public officials by Mr. Curtis, who had been on a one-man campaign for more than a decade to expose what he said was an illicit organ-harvesting scheme at a Tupelo hospital. Mr. Curtis was arrested on April 17. While he was in custody, federal agents searched his home as well as the home of a former wife, but found no evidence tying him to the letters. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that the letters had been carefully written to mimic Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic phrasing and concerns. Though they regretted having arrested a man they now consider innocent, they had wanted to move quickly to prevent more poisoned letters from being sent, one official said. Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s brother Jack said that neither he nor other relatives immediately dismissed the charges as false, given Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s history of mental illness. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could understand, especially with the things that were tied to his initials,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could see why somebody would think it was Kevin. But when they said President Obama, I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Somebody messed up because he likes Obama.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d The family said that Mr. Curtis might have been framed, and Jack Curtis said he told the authorities to look at Mr. Dutschke, who used to work for him and had long had an antagonistic relationship with Mr. Curtis. In a hearing in federal court last Monday, Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer mentioned Mr. Dutschke by name. Mr. Dutschke and Mr. Curtis had feuded, mostly online, on a variety of topics, including their music careers, Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s admittedly false claim of being a member of Mensa , and Mr. Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to publish the organ-harvesting accusations in a local newsletter. Mr. Dutschke, a bright but often abrasive man who ran unsuccessfully for the state legislature, was arrested this year on charges of molesting three under-age girls, one as young as 7. He pleaded not guilty this month. On Tuesday, Mr. Curtis was released, the charges against him dropped. At a news conference, Mr. Curtis said he did not blame the authorities but added that \xe2\x80\x9cthis past week has been a nightmare for me and my family.\xe2\x80\x9d On Tuesday and Wednesday, federal agents searched Mr. Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s home and his former school, Tupelo Taekwondo Plus. James D. Moore, the prosecuting attorney for Lee County, said evidence had been found but he would not characterize its nature. As he became the focus of the inquiry, Mr. Dutschke denied having anything to do with the ricin letters but tried to keep a low profile, to the point where the authorities briefly lost track of him. The strangeness of the whole series of events was not shocking to some who know both men. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been bad blood between those two for years,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Moore said. Of their entanglement in this case, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cHindsight\xe2\x80\x99s 20/20, but knowing these two guys, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d'

S'The federal charges against James Everett Dutschke come days after prosecutors dropped charges against Paul Kevin Curtis in the same case amid Curtis\' claims he was framed. Dutschke, 41, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford on Monday before Magistrate Judge S. Allan Alexander, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Mississippi. Dutschke was arrested without incident at his home early Saturday, FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said. Earlier this week, agents searched Dutschke\'s residence and former martial arts studio, though it\'s not clear what they found. \'A train has been lifted off my shoulder,\' former suspect says The arrest of Dutschke is the latest twist in a bizarre case that began earlier this month when federal investigators arrested Curtis, an Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, for allegedly sending letters containing ricin, a deadly toxin, to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County. The letters touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Authorities later said the Boston bombings and the ricin-tainted letters were unrelated. The revelation of the ricin-laden letters recalled the fear that gripped the country in the days following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks when anthrax-laced letters were sent to U.S. senators and journalists. Curtis cleared The FBI said the recent letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported. Prosecutors on Tuesday dropped the charges against Curtis after his attorney, Christi McCoy, told authorities that she believed her client was framed, possibly by Dutschke. As Curtis, 45, walked out of jail, FBI agents were searching Dutschke\'s home and the studio where he practiced martial arts. At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search "to help clear my name." "I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters," he said. \'I am KC\' The letters read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance." They were signed "I am KC and I approve this message," a source told CNN. Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. Curtis, a self-styled activist known as Kevin Curtis, has used similar signoffs on letters and social media posts, his attorney said. "I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him," attorney McCoy told CNN. Curtis told CNN that he didn\'t even know what ricin was until he got out of jail and looked it up on the Internet. When police stormed his home and arrested him last week, Curtis said an investigator asked him about ricin, and Curtis said he responded, "Well, I don\'t eat rice, and I don\'t have any rice in the house." Online feud Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, has said her client used to work for Curtis\' brother, but the two have had no contact since 2010. Basham declined to comment on Dutschke\'s arrest Saturday. The relationship between the two men is at best hazy, with each publicly accusing the other of bad behavior. Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book, but later had a falling out. He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the former taekwondo instructor has denied. Dutschke told reporters this week that he did not know Curtis well. "He\'s just a little nutty. I don\'t have a relationship with him," he said. "I\'ve met him two times in person, and then there was a third time we sent e-mails back and forth." In the e-mail exchange, according to Dutschke, he accused Curtis of posting a fake membership certificate for MENSA, the high-IQ organization. Curtis acknowledged that he posted a fake certificate, but said he did it to catch Dutschke stalking him online. Ties to letters? Authorities have not said how they linked the letters to Dutschke, who appears to have personal ties to at least two of the three people who were sent letters. In 2007, Dutschke failed in his bid as a Republican to defeat Democratic state representative Steve Holland, whose mother, a judge, received one of the ricin-tainted letters. "We just want to move on," Holland told CNN, adding that he wanted justice for his mother. "This could have been devastating. Mom could have died had this taken the worst-case scenario." Dutschke also has said he has met Wicker. Other charges Dutschke, meanwhile, faces molestation charges in an unrelated case. According to a grand jury indictment handed down this month and obtained by CNN, he is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. The accusations go back as far as 2007, according to the indictment. Dutschke has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media, and he pleaded innocent in court this month. He closed his taekwondo studio after the allegations were made public.'

S'Everett Dutschke, 41, was taken into custody in Tupelo, Miss., and later charged with being in possession of a biological weapon. TUPELO, Miss. \xe2\x80\x94 A Mississippi martial arts instructor arrested early on Saturday was charged with possession of the biological agent ricin and with attempting to use it as a weapon, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. James Everett Dutschke, age 41, was arrested following searches of his home and a former business as part of an investigation into ricin-laced letters sent to President Barack Obama and two other public officials. Dutschke was taken into custody by FBI agents at his Tupelo home in the early hours of Saturday morning, FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said in a statement. If convicted, Dutschke faces maximum possible penalties of life imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and 5 years of supervised release. Dutschke is expected to appear in the United States District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday. U.S. prosecutors dropped charges on Tuesday against another Mississippi man, Elvis impersonator Kevin Curtis, who was released from jail after a search of his home in nearby Corinth revealed no incriminating evidence. Prosecutors said at the time that the investigation had "revealed new information" but provided no details. Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, did not return calls seeking comment but told Reuters earlier in the week that her client denied having anything to do with the ricin letters. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as members of an anti-terrorist response team from the Mississippi National Guard, some wearing hazardous-material suits, had searched Dutschke\'s home Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as the premises of a former martial arts studio Dutschke ran in the city. Dutschke was cooperating with federal officials during the searches this week, the attorney said. The agents had Dutschke\'s home under surveillance Friday afternoon and evening, and moved to arrest him about 1 a.m. local time. On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges against another Mississippi man, Elvis impersonator Kevin Curtis, who was released from jail after a search of his home in nearby Corinth revealed no incriminating evidence. Prosecutors said at the time that the investigation had "revealed new information" but provided no details. The case has brought extra scrutiny on the FBI almost 12 years after a 2001 letter-borne anthrax attack\xc2\xa0after\xc2\xa0the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington. It took investigators seven years to solve the anthrax case. Letters addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and President Barack Obama were retrieved last week at off-site mail facilities before reaching their intended victims. A state judge also received a ricin-laced letter. The discovery added another layer of anxiety as authorities dealt with bombings at the Boston Marathon. Ricin, which is made from castor beans, can be deadly to humans and is considered a potential terrorist weapon, particularly if refined into an aerosol form. Dutschke\'s name first surfaced in a federal court hearing Monday for Curtis in which his attorney suggested her client had been framed by someone. She mentioned a running feud between Dutschke and Curtis, albeit over a number of seemingly petty issues. Suspicion originally had\xc2\xa0fallen on Curtis because of wording contained in all three ricin letters that appeared to incriminate him. "Maybe I have your attention now / Even if that means someone must die," the letters read in part, according to the affidavit. The letters ended: "I am KC and I approve this message." The initials "KC" led law enforcement officials to ask Wicker\'s staff if they were aware of any constituents with those initials, and the focus of the investigation then turned to Curtis, according to an affidavit from the FBI and the Secret Service filed in court.

S'The FBI believes it has the right man this time in the tangled case of the ricin-laced letters mailed to President Obama and two other public officials. In the early-morning darkness Saturday, four days after authorities dropped charges against an Elvis impersonator in Mississippi, FBI agents arrested a man the impersonator had been feuding with \xe2\x80\x94 a former radio announcer and onetime candidate for the state legislature who recently was charged with child molestation. James Everett Dutschke, 41, was taken into custody about 12:50 a.m. Saturday at his home in Tupelo, Miss., the FBI said. He could face life in prison on federal charges of \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly developing, producing, stockpiling, transferring, acquiring, retaining and possessing a biological agent, toxin and delivery system, for use as a weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Oxford, Miss. Dutschke proclaimed his innocence last week, saying he had cooperated with investigators and insisting he had no idea how to manufacture ricin, a toxin derived from the castor bean plant that can kill quickly if inhaled. Lori Nail Basham, Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, declined to comment Saturday on her client\xe2\x80\x99s arrest. Dutschke had been the target of the investigation since the release from jail last week of Paul Kevin Curtis , 45, of Corinth, Miss. Curtis is the Elvis impersonator whom federal investigators initially charged with sending the poison letters to Obama, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Lee County Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland. Holland said in a phone interview Saturday that she can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why Dutschke would have wanted to send her a poisoned letter, as authorities allege \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI have no earthly idea\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but that she does remember having one unpleasant encounter with him. In 2007, Dutschke ran as a Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives against her son, state Rep. Steve Holland, a Democrat. The judge said she attended a rally at which Dutschke excoriated her son\xe2\x80\x99s performance in office. She confronted him afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him: \xe2\x80\x98This is no way to run a campaign. You need to tell the people what you will do and what you have done. Don\xe2\x80\x99t run your opponent down,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Days later, she said, Dutschke came to her office and apologized to her. His candidacy was not successful. Earlier this month, Holland went to work and learned that she had received a letter in an envelope with something granular rattling inside. She opened the letter, which contained a vague death threat and was signed, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is KC and I approve this message.\xe2\x80\x9d She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the mysterious material fall out of the letter, and she washed her hands carefully, she said. She felt no ill effects, but the grainy material was ricin, authorities later determined. The federal investigation initially focused on Curtis , who also had a connection to Holland. She sentenced him to six months in jail for a 2003 assault on a Tupelo lawyer, according to court documents. Curtis had also been hired by Wicker to perform at a party in his Elvis persona.'

S'The concert promoter has no choice to reveal Jackson\'s "deepest, darkest secret" because the company must defend itself from the accusation from Jackson\'s family that it is responsible for the pop icon\'s death, Marvin Putnam said. Before Putnam began, a Jackson lawyer played for the jury a sentimental song Jackson wrote and recorded for his three children titled "You Are My Life." "You are the sun, you make me shine more like the stars that twinkle at night, You are the moon that glows in my heart, You\'re my day time, my nighttime, My world. You are my life." Katherine Jackson, his mother, wiped tears from her face as her late son\'s soft voice filled the small courtroom. And so begins a trial, which could last several months, that promises dramatic revelations and legal fireworks. With opening statements delivered, the Jackson\'s call their first witness Tuesday morning -- Orlando Martinez, the Los Angeles Police detective who investigated Jackson\'s death. AEG Live executives are "ruthless guys" who ignored Michael Jackson\'s health problems and his doctor\'s ethical conflicts, which led to the pop icon\'s death, a Jackson family lawyer argued Monday. Jurors earning $15 a day will decide whether one of the world\'s largest entertainment companies should pay Jackson\'s mother and three children billions of dollars for its liability in the pop icon\'s death. Randy and Rebbie Jackson, Michael\'s siblings, were with their mother in the front row, just a few feet away from jurors. "There will be no question in your mind that they were ruthless and they wanted to be No. 1 at all cost," Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said. AEG executives knew that Jackson was emotionally and physically weak, Panish told jurors. Jackson was in an "obvious sharp decline" in the weeks after Murray began working as his personal doctor while he prepared for his comeback concerts. Another warning sign should have been that Murray asked for $5 million for the job and eventually agreed on $150,000 a month, Panish said. Another doctor had told AEG he would do the job for $40,000 a month as long as Jackson was "clean," meaning not on drugs, he said. Panish played for the jury a video of an AEG expert who agreed that Murray\'s pay demand was "outrageous."

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos denied CNN\'s request to televise the trial. Jurors chosen to decide Michael Jackson wrongful death case The central i ssue The central issue is simple: Did AEG Live, the company promoting Jackson\'s comeback concerts in 2009, hire or supervise Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson\'s June 25, 2009, death? Jackson died two weeks before his "This Is It" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London. The coroner ruled Jackson died from a fatal combination of sedatives and propofol, a surgical anesthetic that Murray told investigators he used to put Jackson to sleep almost every night in the month before his death. The Jacksons argue that AEG executives knew about the star\'s weakened health and his past use of dangerous drugs while on tour. They\'re liable in his death because they pressured Jackson and the doctor to meet their ambitious schedule to prepare for the London shows despite that knowledge, their lawyers contend. A cornerstone of their case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson\'s death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him." Jackson lawyers argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray\'s fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson\'s personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Gongaware, in a video deposition played in court Monday, said he could not remember writing the e-mail, which the Jackson lawyers call the "smoking gun" in their case. "They put Dr. Murray in a position where if he said Michael can\'t go or can\'t play, if he said I can\'t give you those drugs, then he doesn\'t get paid," Panish told jurors Monday. Gongaware, who managed two of Jackson\'s tours in the 1990s, knew that Jackson relied on addictive opiates during his concert tours, Panish said. He played a video of one doctor who said he warned Gongaware about it in 1993. "We felt that we needed to an intervention," Dr. Stuart Finkelstein said. "We needed to do detox." AEG\'s lawyer argued Monday that Gongaware and other AEG executives had no way of knowing about Jackson\'s use of propofol to sleep. "AEG knew nothing about this decade-long propofol use," Putnam said. "They were a concert promoter. How could they know?" He promised that Jackson\'s ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, will testify that she assisted in administering propofol to Jackson in the 1990s when she was a nurse. She saw several doctors put Mr. Jackson to sleep in hotel rooms while on tour," he said, including in Munich, London, Paris. "The truth is Mr. Jackson fooled everyone," Putnam said about Jackson\'s porpofol use. "He kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest, darkest secret." Jackson\'s ability to keep his private side private meant AEG could not see any red flags warning of Jackson\'s destruction, Putnam said. "They didn\'t see this coming," he said. "They had no idea." Putnam said Jackson family members will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening. "If they didn\'t know what was going on, how could someone else think there was even a problem," he said. AEG contends that Jackson was responsible for his own demise, that he chose Murray to be his full-time doctor and that his drug addiction led him to a series of fatal choices. "This case is about personal choices," Putnam said. "People have responsibility for their personal choices. It was not a tragedy of AEG Live\'s making." Murray was never an AEG employee but rather was chosen and paid by Jackson for nearly four years until Jackson died, AEG lawyers contend. "AEG Live never paid Dr. Murray anything, ever," Putnam said. He played a snippet from Murray\'s interview with Martinez two days after Jackson\'s death. "I am an employee for Michael Jackson but paid through AEG," Murray told police. Jackson, not AEG chose Murray, he said. Child molestation accusations against Jackson, for which he was acquitted after a trial, are relevant because they resulted in an increase in his drug use, Putnam said. He focused on Jackson\'s doctor shopping for drugs, displaying a chart of 40 doctors and nurses who Jackson sought drugs from. Elvis\' ghost haunts Michael Jackson death trial Jackson\'s family seeks billions Just before Monday\'s session began, the judge issued a series of rulings that will allow Jackson expert witnesses to testify but limit some of their opinions. The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. Jackson lawyers denied media reports that they were seeking $40 billion in damages if AEG Live is found liable, but it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson\'s income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price. Palazuelos reversed an earlier tentative decision Monday that would have limited the amount of damages the Jacksons could argue AEG should pay if found liable in the singer\'s death. \xc2\xa0The decision raises the potential damages by about $1 billion. One of the Jacksons\' experts, certified public accountant Arthur Erk, estimated that Michael Jackson could have earned $1.4 billion by taking his "This Is It" tour around the world for 260 shows. AEG executives discussed extending the tour beyond the 50 shows scheduled for London, Jackson lawyers said. Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders, in arguing for the judge to allow Erk\'s testimony, said when "This Is It" tickets went on sale in March 2009, there was the "highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world. No one has ever come close." "There was so much demand, they filled 2 million seats in hours," Sanders said, quoting an e-mail from AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips sent to AEG\'s owner. "We would have had to do 100-plus shows to fill the demand" in London, he said Phillips wrote. Jackson could have packed the Tokyo Dome several times in a world tour, he said. But AEG lawyer Sabrina Strong called it "very speculative" that Jackson would have even finished the 50 London shows before dying. AEG lawyers argued that Jackson didn\'t perform 260 shows and make that much money even in his prime. "He never came anywhere close to that," Strong said. "No one other than Cher has ever done that." Erk also calculated Jackson would have followed with four more world tours before he turned 65. Palazuelos weighed in during a hearing on Thursday, noting that the Rolling Stones are still touring into their 70s. The Jacksons will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of Las Vegas shows, endorsements, a clothing line and movies. Strong argued that Jackson had a history of failed projects and missed opportunities, calling Erk\'s projections "a hope, a dream, and not a basis for damages." Erk, under the new ruling, will be able to tell jurors about the\xc2\xa0"loss of earning capacity" suffered by the family because of Jackson\'s death. \xc2\xa0This means the jury can consider the Jackson argument that he\xc2\xa0could have earned millions with a clothing line, endorsements and movies. The expert\'s estimate that Jackson would have completed five world tours before he was 65, if he had lived, can also be considered. AEG can argue, however, that Jackson\'s past failures diminished the potential earnings. None of the Jackson experts can offer an opinion on the question of whether Murray was hired by AEG. The witness lists include many members of the Jackson family, including Katherine Jackson. Other celebrity witnesses on the list are Sharon Osbourne , Quincy Jones, Spike Lee, Ray Parker Jr., Lisa Marie Presley, Diana Ross and Lou Ferrigno.

S'Michael Jackson\'s family and friends knew the King of Pop abused prescription drugs, an attorney for Jackson\'s mother told a Los Angeles jury today, yet the promoters of his ill-fated 2009 comeback tour denied any knowledge of it. In his opening statements today, attorney Brian Panish, who is representing Katherine Jackson in her wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, told jurors that officials with the concert promoter were so focused on beating the competition with Jackson\'s "This Is It" tour that they relentlessly pushed the King of Pop to perform despite numerous warning signs about his health, and negligently hired Dr. Conrad Murray, the man convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol. "They wanted to be No. 1 at all costs," Panish said. "We\'re not looking for any sympathy... We\'re looking for truth and justice." Panish detailed Jackson\'s prescription drug abuse history, saying the singer regularly used demerol and propofol, and that "people who knew him believed he had a problem with prescription medication." "[Michael Jackson\'s] stirring voice, his musical genius, his creativity and his generosity and his huge heart was extinguished forever," Panish said. "You\'re going to hear the whole story about what happened in the death of Michael Jackson." AEG officials have denied all wrongdoing in the civil suit filed by Katherine Jackson and the singer\'s three children, saying that Murray, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011, was an independent contractor hired by Jackson. Marvin S. Putnam, the lawyer representing AEG Live, told jurors in his opening remarks today that the concert promoter officials could not have known about Jackson\'s private life, including his propofol use, and could not have foreseen circumstances that led to a physician giving the pop star doses of the anesthetic as a sleep aid. "The truth is, Michael Jackson fooled everyone," Putnam said. "He made sure that no one, nobody, knew his deepest darkest secrets." Murray is currently serving four years in prison for his role in the pop superstar\'s death and is appealing his conviction. Katherine Jackson and two of her children, Rebbie and Randy Jackson, sat in the front row of the courtroom, as Jackson fans and media thronged the hallways and the areas outside the courthouse. No cameras were allowed inside the courtroom. Tens of millions of dollars, not to mention the worldwide pop music icon\'s reputation, are at stake in this trial. A jury comprised of six men and six women will hear arguments that are expected to last into the summer to decide if AEG is liable for damages. The case is expected to delve into the highly guarded personal life of Jackson, who died at age 50 four years ago, and provide the most in-depth details of the superstar\'s final days. The trial is expected to include detailed testimony about other doctors\' treatment of Jackson, a subject that was largely off-limits in the criminal case. "I think this case is important because in the Conrad Murray case, I think everyone believes we got part of the story of Michael Jackson. This trial is important because we will get the rest of the story," HLN anchor Vinnie Politan told ABC News. A who\'s who of Hollywood was lining up to support the Jackson family. The expected star-studded witness list included Quincy Jones, Diana Ross, Lou Ferrigno and Spike Lee.

S'The owner of a collapsed Bangladesh building was captured Sunday. A fire broke out at the site as rescuers tried to free a trapped woman. SAVAR, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 The fugitive owner of an illegally constructed building that collapsed and killed at least 377 people was captured Sunday by a commando force as he tried to flee into India. At the disaster site, meanwhile, fire broke out in the wreckage and forced authorities to suspend the search for survivors temporarily. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested in the western Bangladesh border town of Benapole, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital of Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. AP Photo: Palash Khan. Bangladesh building collapse: Mohammed Sohel Rana, owner of a Bangladesh building that collapsed, killing 377 people, is paraded before the media after being captured Sunday. Rana\'s capture was announced by loudspeaker at the disaster site, drawing cheers and applause from those awaiting the outcome of a continuing search-and-rescue operation for survivors of Wednesday\'s collapse. Many of those killed were workers at clothing factories in the building, known as the Rana Plaza, and the collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy. The fire that broke out late Sunday night sent smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and halted some of the rescue efforts \xe2\x80\x94 including a bid to free a woman who was found trapped in the rubble. The blaze was caused by sparks as rescuers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescuers were injured in the fire, he said. It forced them to retreat while firefighters frantically hosed down the flames. Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed the trapped woman, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Rescue workers had delayed the use of heavy equipment for several hours in the hope that she could be extricated from the rubble first. But with the woman presumed dead, they began using heavy equipment around midnight. Click image to see more photos An exhausted and disheveled Rana was brought before reporters briefly at the Dhaka headquarters of the commando team, the Rapid Action Battalion. Wearing a printed shirt, Rana was sweating as two security officers held him by his arms. A security official helped him to drink water after he gestured he was thirsty. He did not speak during the 10-minute appearance, and he is likely to be handed over to police, who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours. A small-time politician from the ruling Awami League party, Rana had been on the run since the building collapsed Wednesday. He last appeared in public Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared in the building. Witnesses said he assured tenants, including five garment factories, that the building was safe. Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said the next phase of the search involved heavy equipment such as hydraulic cranes that were brought to the disaster site Sunday. Searchers had been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels, he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. "We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones," Suhrawardy said.

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 A fire broke out late Sunday in the wreckage of the garment factory that collapsed last week in Bangladesh, with smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and some of the rescue efforts forced to stop. The fire came four days after the collapse, as rescuers were trying to free a woman they found trapped in the rubble. The flames broke out when sparks were generated by those rescuers trying to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer rescuer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescue workers were injured in the fire, he said. Rescuers have retreated from the part of the wreckage where the fire erupted, but were still trying to reach any possible survivors in other parts of the destroyed eight-story building. Firefighters were frantically hosing down the flames. "Hopefully we will be able to control it," said Brig. Gen. Mohammed Siddiqul Alam Shikder, who is overseeing rescue operations. It wasn\'t immediately clear what happened to the trapped woman. The fire came hours after the owner of the illegally-constructed building was captured Sunday at a border crossing with India. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested in Benapole in western Bangladesh, just as he was about to flee into India\'s West Bengal state, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Rana\'s capture brought cheers and applause when it was announced on a loudspeaker at the site of the collapsed building in the Dhaka suburb of Savar. At least 377 people are confirmed to have died in the Wednesday collapse. Three of the building\'s floors were built illegally. The death toll is expected to rise but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh\'s garment industry, which is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy.

With more than 800 people still missing and time running out, rescue officials fear the number could rise sharply. [Updated 11:45 a.m. PDT, April 28: Fire broke out in the collapsed building late Sunday night local time, Associated Press reported, forcing a halt to rescue efforts as smoke poured from the stacked slabs of concrete. A rescuer told AP that the fire began when workers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach a trapped woman, and sparks ignited the wreckage. The extent of the fire was not immedately clear. ] Sohel Rana, landlord of the pancaked Rana Plaza, was trying to flee the country when he was detained in the border town of Benapole, police said. Rana is reportedly an official with the ruling party who went into hiding soon after he was rescued from the wreckage of his own building. Local news photos showed him wearing a black and white printed shirt as he was taken into custody by two men in plain clothes. "He has been arrested and will be tried," Bangladesh\'s deputy home minister, Shamsul Haque Tuku, told reporters. Rana Plaza, housing five apparel factories supplying western brands, a shopping plaza and a bank branch, developed cracks Tuesday, according to local media reports. Police condemned the eight-story building, but some factory owners reportedly ordered workers back to their sewing machines just hours before the massive structure collapsed. Reports said an illegal ninth story was under construction. Disaster Management Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali said Sunday the structure didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet building code requirements, was never approved by the government and was built on a wetland using substandard construction materials. The revelations are likely to fan public outrage that\xe2\x80\x99s been burning for days. In addition to Rana, authorities have arrested three factory owners and two government engineers in the growing national crisis.\xc2\xa0 Local media reported that Rana\xe2\x80\x99s mother died of a heart attack on Saturday evening. Meanwhile, fewer people are being pulled out alive with each passing day. The five rescued Sunday compared with approximately two dozen on Saturday and more than 70 on Friday. "The chances of finding people alive are dimming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hassan Sohrawardi, the army official coordinating the rescue operation. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we have to step up our rescue operation to save any valuable life we can." Local television footage showed large cranes parked outside the building. Authorities initially announced they would suspend the rescue operation and start removing the debris at the 72-hour mark, but angry relatives forced them to continue searching. As the stench of decaying bodies grows, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before the focus shifts to a cleanup operation, analysts said. Nine more survivors were spotted under massive pieces of concrete Sunday, spurring an operation to reach them. So far, 2,440 people have been pulled out alive, Dhaka\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Star newspaper reports. The roads were relatively quiet Sunday, with protests limited to a few blocked highways. This followed days of demonstrations and clashes between police and angry garment workers who burned factories, smashed cars and wrecked shops. Opposition forces have called for a national strike Thursday to protest the disaster. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the time for agitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday on a day in which she visited hospitals and promised aid in a bid to stem the civil and political fallout. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the time to stand beside other people.

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh (AP) -- The fugitive owner of an illegally constructed building that collapsed and killed at least 377 people was captured by commandos as he tried to flee into India. At the disaster site, meanwhile, fire broke out in the rubble and forced authorities to suspend the search for survivors temporarily. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested Sunday in the western border town of Benapole, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital of Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Rana\'s capture was announced by loudspeaker at the disaster site, drawing cheers and applause from those awaiting the outcome of a continuing search-and-rescue operation for survivors of Wednesday\'s collapse. Many of those killed worked at clothing factories in the building, known as the Rana Plaza , and the collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth $20 billion annually, supplies global retailers and is a mainstay of the economy. The fire that broke out late Sunday night sent smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and halted some of the rescue efforts \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d including a bid to free a woman who was found trapped in the rubble. The blaze was caused by sparks as rescuers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescuers were injured in the fire, he said. It forced them to retreat while firefighters frantically hosed down the flames. Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed the trapped woman, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Rescue workers had delayed the use of heavy equipment for several hours in the hope that she could be extricated from the rubble first. But with the woman presumed dead, they began using heavy equipment around midnight. An exhausted and disheveled Rana was brought before reporters briefly at the Dhaka headquarters of the commando team, the Rapid Action Battalion. Wearing a printed shirt, Rana was sweating as two security officers held him by his arms. A security official helped him to drink water after he gestured he was thirsty. He did not speak during the 10-minute appearance, and he is likely to be handed over to police, who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours. A small-time political operative from the ruling Awami League party, Rana had been on the run since the building collapsed Wednesday. He last appeared in public Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared in the building. Witnesses said Rana assured tenants, including five garment factories , that the building was safe. Police, however, ordered an evacuation. A bank and some first-floor shops closed, but managers of the garment factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts. Hours later, the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete. Local authorities said the construction permit was issued for a five-story building, not the eight floors that were built. Rana\'s arrest was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader. On Saturday, police arrested three owners of two factories. Also detained were Rana\'s wife and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for the building design. Local TV stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank accounts of the owners of all five garment factories in the Rana Plaza. A garment manufacturers\' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside when it fell. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for. Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said the next phase of the search involved the heavy equipment such as hydraulic cranes that were brought to the disaster site Sunday. Searchers had been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels, he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. "We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones," Suhrawardy said. In a rare bit of good news, a female worker was pulled out alive Sunday. Rescuer Hasan Akbari said when he tried to extricate a man next to the woman, "he said his body was being torn apart. So I had to let go. But God willing, we will be able to rescue him with more help very soon." The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands. The death toll surpassed a fire five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed in Bangladesh. Its garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain\'s Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them. Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorized to be made in the facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorized production. __ AP writers Farid Hossain and Gillian Wong in Dhaka contributed to this report.'

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 The mother stood at the edge of the wreckage, pressing her lips to photos of her two children \xe2\x80\x94 Asma, who had worked in a garment factory on the fourth floor, and Sultan, who worked on the fifth. For five days after the building collapsed, rescue teams had retrieved corpses and survivors, but not her son and daughter. Tears on her cheeks, she began to shout: at a soldier sweating beneath a hard hat, at the shattered building, at her god, and finally at her children, calling out their names, beckoning to them, \xe2\x80\x9cToday, I\xe2\x80\x99m here! But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t come back!\xe2\x80\x9d Thousands of people surrounded the site on Sunday, watching the huge rescue operation, even as hopes faded that many more victims would be found alive. For nearly 12 hours, rescuers tried to save a trapped woman, lowering dry food and juice to her as they carefully cut through the wreckage trying to reach her. But then a fire broke out, apparently killing the woman, leaving many firefighters in tears. With national outrage boiling over, Bangladeshi paramilitary officers tracked down and arrested Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was hiding near the Indian border, and returned him by helicopter to Dhaka. When loudspeakers at the rescue site announced his capture earlier in the day, local news reports said, the crowd broke out in cheers. The collapse of the building, the Rana Plaza, is considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. It is known to have claimed at least 377 lives, and hundreds more workers are thought to be missing still, buried in the rubble. The Rana Plaza building contained five garment factories, employing more than 3,000 workers, who were making clothing for European and American consumers. Labor activists, citing customs records, company Web sites or labels discovered in the wreckage, say that the factories produced clothing for JC Penney; Cato Fashions; Benetton; Primark, the low-cost British store chain; and other retailers. Everywhere near the building, the stench of death was overpowering. Men in surgical masks sprayed disinfectant in the air. Others sprayed air freshener. At one point, the police said, searches inside the structure were suspended because some rescuers were overcome by dust and the odor of decomposing bodies. Savar is a crowded industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and the disaster has overwhelmed local institutions. A high school near Rana Plaza is now a staging ground for the identification of corpses. Nazma Begum, 25, stood beside a crude coffin that contained the remains of her sister, Shamima. She was standing guard over it until her father arrived to take the sister back to their home village to be buried. Sticks of burning incense had been wedged into the coffin to fight the awful smell. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped that my sister was still alive,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that hope is now shattered.\xe2\x80\x9d Like so many young women in the country, the two sisters had gotten work in garment factories to help support their families. Ms. Begum makes about $85 a month; her sister made $56. Now Ms. Begum wants to quit her job. She has heard rumors that the building where she works is unsafe. Just then a group of young men placed another coffin nearby, slid open the wooden lid and sprayed the body with disinfectant. A man on a megaphone made an announcement: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a new body,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as a crowd surged toward the coffin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come and see the body to identify it.\xe2\x80\x9d For days, rescuers crawled though pancaked spaces on their hands and knees, afraid that using heavy machinery would collapse the building further. Lowered precariously into holes, they called out through the rubble and the darkness, listening for the voices of survivors. Many were saved in the painstaking process. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were shouting, asking if anyone was alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharif ul-Islam, 35, a firefighter. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would say, \xe2\x80\x98If anyone is alive, please make a sound! We will come to you!\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Finding and identifying all the missing may take weeks or longer. Thousands of homemade posters for missing loved ones have been affixed to the walls outside the school, to nearby buildings, to the branches of trees, to the gate of Enam Medical College and Hospital, where so many victims are being treated. The posters have a poignant similarity: One husband, Mohammed Siddique, is looking for his wife, Shahida Akter. She is smiling in her photograph, posing with a cellphone. Another husband is looking for Alpana Rani. She is smiling in her photograph, too, holding her daughter. In his ground-floor office, the director of Enam Hospital, Dr. Mohammed Anawarul Quader Nazim, said that more than 650 survivors had been brought in since the Wednesday morning disaster. The scope of injuries was horrifying: fractured skulls, crushed rib cages, severed livers, ruptured spleens. One survivor lost both legs. So many people suffered crushed limbs that his hospital sent a medical team to the wreckage to help handle on-site amputations. He keeps a list of amputees on his desk: A teenage girl named Sania lost her right leg. Another teenager, Anna, lost her right hand. Upstairs in the Intensive Care Unit, Laboni Khanam, 22, lay in a bed, dazed. She was rescued after being trapped for 36 hours, but to save her life, rescuers had to amputate her left arm, which was pinned beneath a pillar. She begged them to save her arm but they told her they had no choice. They gave her an anesthetic but the agony was excruciating. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t describe how painful it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cMy life is ruined now.\xe2\x80\x9d With so many lives ruined or lost, public anger has largely focused on Mr. Rana, the building\xe2\x80\x99s owner. Garment industry leaders have blamed him for lying about the structural safety of the building; when cracks were discovered the day before the disaster, Mr. Rana is accused of assuring factory bosses that the building was safe to operate. After his arrest, Mr. Rana blamed the owners of the garment factories for insisting on operating the morning of the disaster. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not force the owners,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, according to bdnews24.com , an online news source in Bangladesh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was them who forced me, saying they would face huge losses, and shipments would be canceled if the factories were closed for even one day.\xe2\x80\x9d The Rana Plaza disaster, coming five months after 112 garment workers died in a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory, has brought renewed criticism of the failure of Western brands to ensure safe working conditions in the factories they use in Bangladesh. In recent days, different Western brands have expressed sorrow over the accident but none, as yet, has endorsed proposals for tougher independent safety inspection programs. Soon, the rescue efforts at Rana Plaza will likely come to a close and the operation will shift toward clearing the rubble. Late on Sunday night, rescuers started using two cranes and other heavy machinery. Officials are suggesting that few, if any, are likely still alive. Yet there are still thousands of people clinging to hope. A young wife who managed to escape the fourth floor was sitting on the ground, holding a photo of her husband, who had been working on the third floor. And another woman sat less than 50 yards from the building, crying, surrounded by invoices from garment orders that were scattered on the ground. When a soldier asked her to move somewhere safer and farther away from the wreckage, she wailed at him. She had two sons somewhere inside the building. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better if you killed me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan if you asked me to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d'

S'While authorities have not said the raid Sunday had anything to do with the Boston Marathon bombing, one of those killed was an associate of Abu Dujan, the slain leader of a militant islamist organization that produced at least one video that slain bombing suspect Tamarlan Tsarnaev apparently posted and later removed from a social media account, according to a nalysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Group . Videos linked to the group show how to make homemade explosive devices, among other things. U.S. investigators have been looking into whether Tsarnaev could have been influenced by such groups during his six-month visit to the region in 2012. The interplay between U.S. officials and their counterparts in Russia -- who have been battling islamist militants in the region for years -- has emerged as a key thread in discussions surrounding the April 15 Boston bombing, which killed three and left more than 260 wounded. Authorities say Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, also shot a police officer to death. Over the weekend, an official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Russian authorities had intercepted a phone call in early 2011 from one of the Tsarnaev brothers in the U.S. to their mother in Dagestan. The wiretapped communication discussed jihad but the conversation was vague, according to two U.S. officials. It\'s unclear why the Russians were eavesdropping on the mother or for how long. CNN has previously reported that the FBI conducted an investigation -- including an interview with Tsarnaev -- after Russia expressed concerns in 2011. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev\'s mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, according to several sources. Her name was subsequently added to a terrorism database along with her son\'s, an intelligence official said last week. The FBI said at the time it found nothing to justify further investigation and that Russia did not respond to U.S .requests for more information. The case was closed after several months. One of the officials declined to say whether the information from the wiretapped phone call would have made a difference in uncovering plans for a future attack on the U.S. However, CNN contributor Tom Fuentes says the FBI would have found that information helpful after Russians officials asked agency to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev for a possible shift toward increasing Islamic extremism. On Monday, Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN\'s Nick Paton Walsh that she plans to come to the United States if she can see her son -- despite pending shoplifting charges against her in Massachusetts. The 19-year-old suspect is now at Federal Medical Center Devens , about 40 miles west of Boston. Authorities moved him there last week from Boston\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. He is able to speak and has been interacting with staff, a prison spokesman said. He has, however, apparently been less talkative since authorities read him his Miranda rights three days after his capture. But the information the hein two sessions of questioning has produced good leads, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. In other developments over the weekend: -- Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that he was comfortable with the handling of the initial questioning of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at a Boston hospital. A magistrate\'s decision to read him his constitutitional rights was "totally consistent with the laws that we have," Holder said. "We have a two-day period to question him under the \'public safety\' exception. So I think everything was done appropriately, and we got good leads." -- Authorities have finished combing a New Beford, Massachusetts, landfill for clues that may shed light on the bloody attack, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller. She wouldn\'t say whether investigators turned up anything. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had said investigators were looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\'s laptop computer. Tsarnaev led authorities to look there, the source said, and others who may have knowledge of the computer\'s whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that prompted the search. -- The boat where Tsarnaev was captured in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home has been taken to an undisclosed location to be thoroughly examined, according to the FBI. Russia intercepted a communication between the mother of the accused Boston Marathon bombers and someone who may have been one of her sons "discussing jihad" in 2011, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. This source described the conversation as vague. The Russians turned over the intercept to the FBI in the past few days, the official said. This source was not aware of a reason for the delay and did not offer an opinion about whether it would have given the FBI enough reason to justify a closer look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the oldest of the two brothers suspected of killing three people near the finish of the marathon on April 15. More than 260 people also were injured as a result of the two blasts, and 28 remain hospitalized after nearly two weeks. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was asked about the report while attending the White House Correspondents\' Dinner on Saturday. "That\'s an ongoing matter," Holder said. "I can\'t really comment on that." CNN has previously reported that the FBI has said that it conducted an investigation -- including an interview with Tsarnaev after Russia expressed concerns in 2011. The FBI said at the time it found nothing to justify pursuing the matter further and that Russia did not respond to U.S .requests for more information. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev\'s mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, when they approached the U.S. about concerns regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to several sources. The mother\'s name was subsequently added to Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database at the same time as her son\'s, an intelligence official said Thursday.\xc2\xa0TIDE is a collection of more than a half-million names of suspected terrorists maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center.\xc2\xa0 The FBI interviewed the mother in 2011 as part of the investigation into her son. The case was closed after several months. Holder also responded to criticism that the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was read his Miranda rights. "The decision to Mirandize him was one that the magistrate made and that was totally consistent with the laws that we have," Holder said. "We have a two-day period to question him under the \'public safety\' exception. So I think everything was done appropriately, and we got good leads." Officials also believe Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier was killed by one or both of the brothers three days after the marathon attack, leading to the manhunt in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed. In developments Monday, Russian special forces killed two members of a jihadist group during an early morning raid in Dagestan, a semi-autonomous republic in southern Russia, two Russian police sources told CNN. One of those killed, Shakhrudin Askhabov, was a close associate of Abu Dujan, the islamist group\'s leader. Analysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Group last week said Tsarnaev appears to have posted and removed a video from Abu Dujan. Videos linked to the group show how to prepare homemade explosives from almost anywhere. No official connection has been made by investigators between the Tsarnaev brothers and the Abu Dujan group. FBI: Search of dump tied to suspect ends Since the pair of blasts turned celebratory cheers into screams of horror at the Boston Marathon\'s finish line, investigators keep working -- interviewing people and searching for evidence, even when it meant sifting through trash -- to find out why. One of the most recent focuses of the probe has been at a landfill in New Bedford, Massachusetts, adjacent to the town where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended school at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Authorities have finished combing the dump for clues that may shed light on the bloody attack, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, who wouldn\'t say whether investigators turned up anything. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had said investigators were looking for Tsarnaev\'s laptop computer. Tsarnaev led authorities to look there, the source said, and others who may have knowledge of the computer\'s whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that prompted the search. A boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home where Tsarnaev was captured has been taken to an undisclosed location, to be thoroughly examined, according to the FBI. Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said the investigation remains open, with interviews and the search for evidence continuing. The 19-year-old suspect is now at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Devens , the federal inmate medical center to which he was transferred from Boston\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. Tsarnaev has been less talkative since authorities read him his Miranda rights three days after his capture. But the information the teenager gave investigators in two sessions of questioning has produced good leads, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Photos: Galleries from the attack and aftermath Family in Russia The brothers\' mother said Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, had said he\'d planned to travel to the United States. But that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons. The mother will not be flying to the United States, where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. The family lived in Massachusetts before Zubeidat Tsarnaev jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year. Suspects\' mother describes her last conversation with her sons Zubeidat Tsarnaev has denied the reality of the bombing. She believes it was fake. She said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea, and that there was no blood, that paint was used instead. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows Botched hijacking thwarts plans to head to New Yor k Three days after the marathon attack, and hours after authorities released images of the two suspects, they spontaneously decided to go to New York\'s Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators. But a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined by New York\'s police commissioner. Before forcing their way into a vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers shot dead a campus police officer at MIT, police said. The vehicle they subsequently hijacked, a Mercedes sport utility vehicle, ran low on fuel, and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle\'s owner escaped. Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV and pursued it. Authorities say the men threw bombs out the vehicle\'s window at them. The gunbattle and Tamerlan Tsarnaev\'s death followed.

S'The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional rights to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, officials said Wednesday. It is unclear whether those statements before the Miranda rights warning would be admissible in a criminal trial and, if not, whether prosecutors even need them to win a conviction. Officials said physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene. The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough. The U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press were close to the investigation but insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters. Tamerlan, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries sustained during a getaway attempt. Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured. More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as "two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis." Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said. How much of those conversations will end up in court is unclear. The FBI normally tells suspects they have the right to remain silent before questioning them so all their statements can be used against them. Under pressure from Congress, however, the Department of Justice has said investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about that. Regardless, investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. An FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that." Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said. The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat. Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, "I\'m not going to talk about that." Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report. "Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him." Schwartz said. "And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... \xc2\xa0To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn\'t change anything for me." Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty. The suspects\' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan\'s body back to Russia. In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers\' parents, hoping to gain more information. Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia\'s turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade. At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing. The line of mourners stretched for a half-mile. They had to make their way through tight security, including metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs. Boston native James Taylor sang "The Water is Wide" and led a sing-along of "Shower the People." Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting. "The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it\'s going to be OK," Biden said. "When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye." The vice president also sounded a defiant note. "The purpose of terror is to instill fear," he said. "You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world." In another milestone in Boston\'s recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed. "I don\'t think there\'s going to be a sense of normalcy for a while," Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. "There are scars here that will be with us for a long time." \xc2\xa0'

S'Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the FBI about his role in the Boston Marathon bombings before he was read his Miranda rights, two U.S. officials said Wednesday. WASHINGTON \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional right to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his rights on Monday, he immediately stopped talking, according to four officials of both political parties who were briefed on the interrogation but insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private. After roughly 16 hours of questioning, investigators were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney\'s office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, the four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. It is unclear whether any of this will matter in court since the FBI says Tsarnaev confessed to a witness and U.S. officials said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene. But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering. Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment." Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough. The U.S. officials who discussed the terrorist database and other details of the investigation are in addition to those who discussed the Miranda warning. They were close to the investigation and insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.

But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.'
p1474
aS'More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.'
p1475
aS'Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as "two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis."'
p1476
aS'Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.'
p1477
aS'Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.'
p1478
aS'Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty.'
p1479
aS'Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.'
p1480
aS'That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that."'
p1481
aS'Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.'
p1482
aS'The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.'
p1483
aS'Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, "I\'m not going to talk about that."'
p1484
aS'Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.'
p1485
aS'"Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him." Schwartz said. "And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn\'t change anything for me."'
p1486
aS"The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia."
p1487
aS"In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information."
p1488
aS"Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade."

Tsarnaev has not answered any questions since he was given a lawyer and told he has the right to remain silent by Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler on Monday, officials said. For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday, April 27, 2013 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 Local Desk 1 inches; 47 words Type of Material: Correction Boston bombings: In the April 26 Section A, an article about the Boston bombings identified Eugene Fidell, a legal expert on U.S. military law, as a professor at the Yale School of Law. He is a lecturer at the school, which is known as Yale Law School. Until that point, Tsarnaev had been responding to the interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, including admitting his role in the bombing, authorities said. A senior congressional aide said Tsarnaev had asked several times for a lawyer, but that request was ignored since he was being questioned under the public safety exemption to the Miranda rule. The exemption allows defendants to be questioned about imminent threats, such as whether other plots are in the works or other plotters are on the loose. After being briefed on the sequence of events, lawmakers from both parties questioned Thursday why the Justice Department didn\'t seek to delay the judge\'s appearance on the grounds that the public safety interview was continuing. Legal experts said that once documents charging Tsarnaev with using a weapon of mass destruction were signed Sunday night, criminal rules of procedure require that he be brought before a judge "without unnecessary delay," which usually means the next business day. Lawmakers were told Tsarnaev had been questioned for 16 hours over two days. Injured in the throat, he was answering mostly in writing. "For those of us who think the public safety exemption properly applies here, there are legitimate questions about why he was [brought before a judge] when he was," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), a former federal prosecutor who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the committee, wrote Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. asking for a full investigation of the matter, complaining that the court session "cut off a lawful, ongoing FBI interview to collect public safety information." Justice Department officials Thursday did not address the question of why they signed documents charging Tsarnaev on Sunday night, knowing that could start the clock ticking toward an appearance by a magistrate. Once that was done, they said, they had no legal way to stop the hearing from going forward. A congressional official said interrogators left the hospital room about an hour before the judge arrived, after they were told she was coming. Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said, "The prosecutors and FBI agents in Boston were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance." One Justice Department official put it another way: "You don\'t tell a federal judge to put off a hearing." Eugene Fidell, a professor at Yale School of Law, said it was past time for Tsarnaev to have been read his rights, because the Constitution requires it. "The notion that the public safety exemption was going to allow them all the time in the world is preposterous," he said.'

S'Updated 5:00 p.m. BOSTON Sixteen hours after investigators began interrogating him, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings went silent: He\'d just been read his constitutional rights. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev immediately stopped talking after a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney\'s office entered his hospital room and gave him his Miranda warning, a U.S. law enforcement source and four officials of both political parties briefed on the interrogation told The Associated Press. They insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private. The Department of Justice said the reading of Tsarnaev\'s Miranda rights was coordinated with prosecutors, the federal defender, the court reporter, the U.S. Marshal Service and the hospital. Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack that detonated pressure-cooker bombs at the marathon finish line, two U.S. officials said. Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video The CIA, however, had named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, a U.S. official told CBS News senior correspondent John Miller. The new disclosure that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was included within a huge, classified database of known and suspected terrorists before the attacks was expected to drive congressional inquiries in coming weeks about whether the Obama administration adequately investigated tips from Russia that Tsarnaev had posed a security threat. Shortly after the bombings, U.S. officials said the intelligence community had no information about threats to the marathon before the April 15 explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev died Friday in a police shootout hours before Dzhokhar was discovered hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis had said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat, but Miller has reported that the suspect was unarmed when captured by police. Police fired upon the boat after one officer on high ground saw the tarp covering the boat flip up and a hand come out holding an object, Miller reports. The officer thought the object was a bomb, prompting him to fire some rounds at the suspect. Other officers believed the object was a gun and the shots came from him, so they fired on the boat. Washington is piecing together what happened and whether there were any unconnected dots buried in U.S. government files that, if connected, could have prevented the bombings. Lawmakers who were briefed by the FBI said they have more questions than answers about the investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said lawmakers intend to pursue whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing, though Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said he "hasn\'t seen any red flags thus far." U.S. officials were expected to brief the Senate on the investigation Thursday. The suspects\' father said Thursday that he is leaving Russia for the United States in the next day or two, but their mother said she was still thinking it over. Anzor Tsarnaev has expressed a desire to go to the U.S. to find out what happened with his sons, defend his hospitalized 19-year-old son Dzhokhar and if possible bring his older son\'s body back to Russia for burial. Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who was charged with shoplifting in the U.S. last summer, said she has been assured by lawyers that she would not be arrested, but was still deciding whether to go. It is unclear whether the issue of their younger son\'s constitutional rights will matter since the FBI say he confessed to a witness. U.S. officials also said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the bombing scene. But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering. Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email late Wednesday, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment." Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.

aS'The CIA, however, had named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, a U.S. official told CBS News senior correspondent John Miller.'
p1625
aS'The new disclosure that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was included within a huge, classified database of known and suspected terrorists before the attacks was expected to drive congressional inquiries in coming weeks about whether the Obama administration adequately investigated tips from Russia that Tsarnaev had posed a security threat.'
p1626
aS'Shortly after the bombings, U.S. officials said the intelligence community had no information about threats to the marathon before the April 15 explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260.'
p1627
aS'Tsarnaev died Friday in a police shootout hours before Dzhokhar was discovered hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard.'
p1628
aS'Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis had said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat, but Miller has reported that the suspect was unarmed when captured by police.'
p1629
aS'Police fired upon the boat after one officer on high ground saw the tarp covering the boat flip up and a hand come out holding an object, Miller reports. The officer thought the object was a bomb, prompting him to fire some rounds at the suspect. Other officers believed the object was a gun and the shots came from him, so they fired on the boat.'
p1630
aS'Washington is piecing together what happened and whether there were any unconnected dots buried in U.S. government files that, if connected, could have prevented the bombings.'
p1631
aS'Lawmakers who were briefed by the FBI said they have more questions than answers about the investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said lawmakers intend to pursue whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing, though Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said he "hasn\'t seen any red flags thus far."'
p1632
aS'U.S. officials were expected to brief the Senate on the investigation Thursday.'
p1633
aS"The suspects' father said Thursday that he is leaving Russia for the United States in the next day or two, but their mother said she was still thinking it over."
p1634
aS"Anzor Tsarnaev has expressed a desire to go to the U.S. to find out what happened with his sons, defend his hospitalized 19-year-old son Dzhokhar and if possible bring his older son's body back to Russia for burial."
p1635
aS'Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who was charged with shoplifting in the U.S. last summer, said she has been assured by lawyers that she would not be arrested, but was still deciding whether to go.'
p1636
aS"It is unclear whether the issue of their younger son's constitutional rights will matter since the FBI say he confessed to a witness. U.S. officials also said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the bombing scene."
p1637
aS'But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering.'
p1638
aS'Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email late Wednesday, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment."'
p1639
aS'Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.'

aS"U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan in Russia and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information."
p1644
aS"They are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade."
p1645
aS'Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.'
p1646
aS'Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty.'
p1647
aS'Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.'
p1648
aS'That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that."'
p1649
aS'Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of an April 18 gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.'

S'"Something very bad happened," the police chief of Norton Shores, a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids, told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV . "This was an abduction, not just a missing person," Chief Daniel Shaw told the station. "There was nothing disturbed inside the store. There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred," Shaw told the station. Heeringa\'s purse was left in the store, and her car was still there, WOOD reported. Heeringa last served a customer about 10:50 p.m., police said. "Between the time that last purchase was made and the time that the customers came in and found the store empty is when Jessica was abducted," Shaw told WOOD. "We have spoken with the person who made the purchase there and cleared them of any wrong. And unfortunately, they didn\'t see anything that would lead them to believe there was something going on at the store that was leading to that abduction." The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store\'s parking area late Friday. Shaw described him as a white male, between 30 and 40, with wavy hair parted in the middle, according to WOOD. The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, he told the station. The store did not have security cameras, leaving police with few other clues. "We are desperately looking for additional information," he told WOOD on Monday morning. Heeringa\'s family and friends were posting missing posters around the area, and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support. "We are searching! Hang tight! The whole Country wants you home!" said a Facebook post from Monday morning. Tips had come in from as far away as New Jersey, Missouri and Arkansas, WOOD reported. Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. She has a 3-year-old son, her family told CNN affiliate WZZM-TV . Besides local police, the county sheriff\'s department and the Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation, according to local media reports. The FBI has also been contacted, the reports said. "We\'ve got a team of detectives and investigators on staff all day and night to track down those leads," Shaw told WOOD. "We are very concerned. It\'s been too long," Heeringa\'s grandfather, Roman Homrich, told Mlive.com on Monday. Heeringa\'s mother, Shelly Heeringa, told WZZM that she thinks her daughter\'s abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store. "She\'s very helpful, that\'s why I think he lured her out of the gas station," the mother told the station. "He knew there wasn\'t security cameras." People with information that may help find Heeringa are asked to call the Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691.'

S'DETROIT (AP) \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Several friends and acquaintances of a petite 25-year-old gas station clerk who went missing while working the night shift have been ruled out in her disappearance, which western Michigan investigators are treating as an abduction, the local police chief said Monday. Police have frustratingly little evidence as they search for Jessica Heeringa , who disappeared Friday night shortly before the young mother was set to close an Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores. The station didn\'t have a security camera and there were no signs of a struggle or robbery, though police have released a description of a vehicle and a man seen in the area. Norton Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw said relatives, friends and other people associated with Heeringa have been interviewed, and that investigators are "no longer really concerned with their activities from that night." "We\'re moving on, trying to find other people," Shaw said. A man trying to buy gas called police after finding the gas station open but no employees around. "There\'s nobody here," Craig Harpster , 54, told a 911 operator in a recorded conversation authorities released Monday. "I hollered, \'Hey,\' walked around the building. ... It just seems strange." Investigators later found Herringa\'s purse and other personal belongings in the station, and the cash register untouched. Police described Herringa as 5-foot-1 and about 110 pounds. "There\'s no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed," Shaw said. "The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing. Her purse was in the store with 400-some dollars in it. It\'s just odd how that occurred." Shaw said nearly two dozen law enforcement officials are following leads. The police chief described the city, home to about 24,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan, as "quite safe" with a low rate of violent crime. "The family believes that Jessica more than likely left to help (someone) in some way," Shaw said. "Their belief is that someone that she\'s either acquainted with or someone she was trying to help lured her out." Police are searching for a gray minivan and its driver, who is described as a white man, age 30 to 40, about 6 feet tall, with light brown wavy hair. The description is from witnesses who saw the van parked near the station and driving away. Heeringa\'s mother, Shelly Heeringa , told local media that she repeatedly told her daughter she worried about her working late by herself. "She said, \'Mom, don\'t worry. I can handle anybody,\'" she said.'

S'A civilian cargo plane owned by an American company crashed at Bagram Air Field, north of the Afghan capital, soon after takeoff on Monday, killing all seven people aboard, the U.S.-led military coalition said. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the Boeing 747-400, but NATO said in a statement to The Associated Press that the Taliban "claims are false." The coalition says the cause of the crash was being investigated by emergency crews that rushed to the site, but there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time. Capt. Luca Carniel, a coalition spokesman, said the aircraft crashed from a low altitude right after takeoff. The plane \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Florida-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d was carrying vehicles and other cargo, according to National Air Cargo Vice President Shirley Kaufman. She said those killed were four pilots, two mechanics and a load master, who was responsible for making sure that the weight and balance of the cargo is appropriate. Five of the seven fatalities were from Michigan, said Kaufman. "We are not yet releasing the identities of the colleagues we lost out of respect for their families who need a little more time to reach other loved ones," she said in an email to the AP. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority are investigating the crash, she said. National Airlines was based until recently at Michigan\'s Willow Run Airport, west of Detroit in Wayne County\'s Van Buren Township. It carries cargo both commercially and for the military, Kaufman said. She said it employs about 225 people. In another development, Afghan President Hamid Karzai accused U.S. forces of killing four civilians and wounding one in the eastern province of Nangarhar on Sunday after an American convoy was attacked by insurgents. In a statement issued by his office, Karzai "strongly condemned the killing of innocent civilians." The U.S.-led military coalition said it was still investigating the weekend clash, which left four soldiers with minor injuries and damaged a patrol vehicle. In a statement issued on Monday, the coalition said the Taliban attacked the coalition patrol with small arms fire and roadside bombs as it moved through a local bazaar in the province where there were civilians. "Coalition forces engaged the enemy, pushed through the hostile area, and traveled to a nearby Afghan National Army checkpoint," the coalition said in a statement. "An investigation is currently underway to assess whether there are any civilian casualties as a result of insurgent fire." \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Associated Press writers Amir Shah and Thomas Wagner in Kabul contributed to this report.'

S'DETROIT \xe2\x80\x94 Jamie Brokaw was an experienced navigator who was no stranger to dangerous flying situations and had the skills to stay cool in the face of danger, according to close friend Chris Connerton. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a very good person and very smart person,\xe2\x80\x9d Connerton told The Associated Press by telephone from Rochester, Minn. Brokaw, 33, of Monroe, Mich., was among seven Americans killed Monday when their National Air Cargo plane crashed near an Air Force base in Afghanistan. Six of the victims were from Michigan and a seventh was from Kentucky, said Shirley Kaufman, National Air Cargo vice president. Connerton said Brokaw was a key reason he was able to make it through flight school in Jacksonville, Fla., where they met. Connerton also described a harrowing flight two years ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, Fla. Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that he could no longer get it to climb. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Jamie\xe2\x80\x99s navigation and know-how ... we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Connerton said. Killed along with Brokaw in the Afghanistan crash were maintenance worker Gary Stockdale, 51, of Romulus, Mich.; pilots Brad Hasler, 34, of Trenton, Mich., and Jeremy Lipka, 37, of Brooklyn, Mich.; first officer Rinku Summan, 32, of Canton, Mich.; loadmaster Michael Sheets, 36, of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and maintenance crewman Timothy Garrett, 51, of Louisville, Ky. Building model planes and working on real ones comprised Stockdale\xe2\x80\x99s passion, filling the family\xe2\x80\x99s basement with models in his youth, jumping into aviation as a career at age 16 \xe2\x80\x94 and later working at two Detroit-area airports. Stockdale also knew the dangers of flying, his older brother said Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always said it was dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Glenn Stockdale, 55. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would always say, \xe2\x80\x98You either will die in a car crash or a ball of flame in a plane.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Lipka had flow in Iraq as well as Afghanistan and had close calls before, said his stepfather, Dave Buttman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was risk there all the time. He knew the risks. He volunteered to take the trips,\xe2\x80\x9d Buttman told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, you\xe2\x80\x99re taking your chances flying in there and he was just happy to be one of the pilots to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d The Dubai-bound Boeing 747-400 \xe2\x80\x94 operated by National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 crashed just after takeoff Monday from Bagram Air Base around 11:20 a.m. local time, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Tuesday. The accident site is within the perimeter of Bagram Air Base. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the plane, but NATO said the claims were false and there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time of the crash. The NTSB said it will lead a team of three investigators to assist the Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation in investigating the crash. But a ministry spokesman, Nangoialy Qalatwal, said Tuesday the ministry is not involved with the investigation because it occurred at a military and not a civilian airport. Kaufman said the plane \xe2\x80\x94 owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Fla.-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 was carrying vehicles and other cargo. Elena Garrett, of Jeffersonville, Ind., just across the Ohio River from Louisville, said ex-husband Timothy Garrett would have turned 52 on Saturday. They have two daughters together, ages 11 and 12. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all devastated,\xe2\x80\x9d Elena Garrett said about his death. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were still best friends. He\xe2\x80\x99s the best father I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen (and) ready to help anybody. He would give the shirt off his back for anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Hasler said his family learned Monday morning that his brother, Brad, was one of the crash victims. \xe2\x80\x9cBrad was a wonderful father to two young children, a beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son, and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Hasler said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cHis influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable.\xe2\x80\x9d National Airlines was based until recently at Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s Willow Run Airport, west of Detroit.

S'DETROIT The friend of one of seven Americans killed in a cargo plane crash near an Air Force base in Afghanistan described him as an experienced navigator who performed well under pressure. First Officer Jamie Brokaw, of Monroe, was among six people from Michigan killed Monday, along with one person from Kentucky. Image of Boeing 747-400 seconds before it crashed after taking off from Bagram Air Base in Afgthanistan on April 29, 2013 "He was a very good person and very smart person," Chris Connerton told The Associated Press Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, Minn. Connerton credited Brokaw with helping get him through flight school, as well as a harrowing flight two years ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, Fla. Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that he could no longer get it to climb. "If it wasn\'t for Jamie\'s navigation and know-how ... we wouldn\'t have made it," Connerton said. "I don\'t know that I would have had the capacity to handle the situation on my own." Image of Boeing 747 seconds after its crash after taking off from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on April 29, 2013. 9 Photos Also killed in Monday\'s crash were pilots Brad Hasler of Trenton, Mich. and Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn, Mich.; First Officer Rinku Summan of Canton, Mich.; loadmaster Michael Sheets of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and maintenance crew Gary Stockdale of Romulus, Mich. and Timothy Garrett of Louisville, Ky. As loadmaster, Sheets was responsible for making sure the weight and balance of the cargo was appropriate. The Dubai-bound Boeing 747-400 was operated by National Air Cargo and crashed just after takeoff Monday from Bagram Air Base around 11:20 a.m. local time, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Tuesday. The video taken from YouTube appears to show the crash of the Boeing 747, even though the time stamp on the camera is off. The National Transportation Safety Board is studying the video for evidence about the crash. The accident site is within the perimeter of Bagram Air Base. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the plane, but NATO said later the claims were false, and there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time of the crash. The Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation is leading the investigation. The NTSB is investigating the crash alongside the ministry.

S'A team of federal investigators and representatives from Boeing Co. are headed for Afghanistan to examine a cargo plane crash that took place Monday at U.S.-operated Bagram Air Base.\xc2\xa0 The cause of the accident is unknown, but the plane\xe2\x80\x99s operator, National Air Cargo, confirmed that all seven American civilian crew members were killed and the aircraft, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, was completely destroyed. "Safety is always our top priority at National Airlines," company President Glen Joerger said in a statement. "This is a devastating loss for our family and we\'ll work diligently with authorities to find the cause. Most importantly, our thoughts and prayers are with our crew members and their families." Coalition forces rely heavily on contracted aircraft to haul troops and supplies in a nation where roadside bombs and insurgent attacks make traveling by road dangerous. Bagram, just north of the country\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Kabul, is one of the two largest air bases serving coalition forces in Afghanistan. National Air Cargo said the 747 was filled with vehicles and other freight when it took off at 11:20 a.m. local time headed for Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International Airport, in the United Arab Emirates. Video footage of a crash surfaced on the Internet Tuesday, and depicted a jumbo jet taking off into overcast skies, before stalling, nose-diving and plummeting to the ground. The plane explodes upon impact and is engulfed in a massive fire ball. The video appears to be shot from a dashboard camera on a vehicle as it travels on a road toward an airport. The date on the dash cam is wrong, but was published within 24 hours of the crash. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed that officials have seen the video, but have not confirmed its origin or authenticity. Regardless, the NTSB confirmed it will lead a team to assist the Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation in the crash investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing\xc2\xa0will also provide technical assistance to investigating authorities. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but the insurgent group often issues false claims. It was the second crash in three days involving coalition aircraft in Afghanistan. On Saturday, four U.S. airmen were killed when a military turboprop plane crashed in southern Afghanistan. Times staff writers David Zucchino and Hashmat Baktash in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.

"Cargo consisted of vehicles and routine general cargo." National specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses, as well as charter passenger service in the Middle East. The cause of the crash has not been determined. But Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group shot down the aircraft and that "several foreign soldiers were killed." That claim could not be immediately verified. But in the past, the Taliban has exaggerated casualty figures. "This is a devastating loss for our family and we\'ll work diligently with authorities to find the cause," National Airlines President Glen Joerger said in the statement.

S'MOJAVE, Calif. Virgin Galactic\'s SpaceShipTwo made its first powered flight Monday, breaking the sound barrier in a test over the Mojave Desert that moves the company closer to its goal of flying paying passengers on brief hops into space. "It couldn\'t have gone more smoothly," said Sir Richard Branson, who owns the spaceline with Aabar Investments PJC of Abu Dhabi. A special twin-fuselage jet carrying SpaceShipTwo took off at about 7:00 a.m. PDT, spent 45 minutes climbing to an altitude of 48,000 feet and released the spaceship. Pilot Mark Stucky and co-pilot Mike Alsbury then triggered SpaceShipTwo\'s rocket engine. The engine burned for 16 seconds, propelling the spaceship to an altitude of 55,000 feet and a velocity of Mach 1.2, surpassing the speed of sound. SpaceShipTwo then glided to a safe landing at Mojave Air and Space Port in the desert north of Los Angeles, said George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic\'s CEO. The 10-minute test flight was considered a major step for the program. "Having spaceship and rocket perform together in the air is a long way toward getting into space," said Branson, who watched from the ground. "A few more test flights with slightly bigger burns every time, and then we\'ll all be back here to watch it go into space." Play Video Until Monday, SpaceShipTwo had only performed unpowered glide flights. Several powered flights are planned this summer, culminating with a dash into space targeted toward the end of the year. SpaceShipTwo is a prototype commercial version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first privately developed manned rocket to reach space. Since the historic flight, more than 500 aspiring space tourists have paid $200,000 or plunked down deposits, patiently waiting for a chance to float in weightlessness and view the Earth\'s curvature from 62 miles up. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin in 2007, but a deadly explosion during ground testing and longer-than-expected test flights pushed the deadline back. No date has been set for the first commercial flight from a custom-designed spaceport in New Mexico, but Virgin Galactic executives have said it will come after testing is complete and it secures approval from the government.

"The successful outcome of this test marks a pivotal point for our program. We will now embark on a handful of similar powered flight tests, and then make our first test flight to space." SpaceShipTwo is a suborbital vehicle, designed to carry space tourists on trips to the edge of space and back for $200,000 a ride. Though these flights wouldn\'t make a full orbit of the planet, they would provide passengers with a brief experience of weightlessness and a view of Earth from the blackness of space. Virgin Galactic is backed by British billionaire Richard Branson , who was on the ground at Mojave to view the flight Monday. "This is a momentous day and the single most important flight test to date for our Virgin Galactic program," Branson wrote in a blog post on Virgin\'s website. "What a feeling to be on the ground with all the team in Mojave to witness the occasion." If test flights continue to go well, SpaceShipTwo may carry passengers as soon as this year or 2014, Virgin Galactic officials have said.

Or, he added, possibly in the first quarter of next year. He and his children are to be passengers on that first flight. Mr. Branson founded Virgin Galactic eight and a half years ago, capitalizing on the success of the first privately financed spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, to carry people above an altitude of 62 miles, considered the edge of outer space. SpaceShipOne had only two seats, and, in its flights, carried only the pilot. Mr. Branson hired Burt Rutan, SpaceShipOne\xe2\x80\x99s designer, and Mr. Rutan\xe2\x80\x99s company, Scaled Composites, to build a larger version called SpaceShipTwo with seats for six passengers, each of whom would pay $200,000 to reach space. He predicted that commercial flights would begin in 2007. That goal was delayed by technological challenges, including an explosion during a propulsion test at Scaled Composites in 2007 that killed three workers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough 8.5 years, trying to get everything right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Branson said. \xe2\x80\x9cToday really was almost the culmination of all that.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the past two and a half years, SpaceShipTwo has made a series of tests as a glider. On Monday morning, with Mr. Branson among the spectators, a carrier aircraft lofted SpaceShipTwo to a height of 47,000 feet before letting it go. This time, it did more than glide. The engine roared for 16 seconds, accelerating SpaceShipTwo to Mach 1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 1.2 times the speed of sound \xe2\x80\x93 and pushing it to an altitude of 55,000 feet, about 10.5 miles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see very, very clearly the plume of flames coming out the back of the spaceship,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Branson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see it speeding up through the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d With the engine off, it then glided to landing about 10 minutes later. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore it\xe2\x80\x99s lit, there\xe2\x80\x99s natural nervousness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Branson, who stood next to Mr. Rutan during the test flight. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it was lit, it was a moment of relief, but also actually joy for every single person standing there.\xe2\x80\x9d More test flights will follow as SpaceShipTwo goes faster and higher before the start of commercial operations, which will be launched from Spaceport America outside Las Cruces, N.M.

S'The space tourism firm Virgin Galactic has successfully test-fired the rocket motor designed to boost a passenger spaceliner on suborbital joy rides into space.

The Eve mother ship ended up with a slight ding on its tail in April during what was then its longest test run yet. "SpaceShipTwo, which will air launch from Eve, is largely constructed and awaiting the start of its own test flight program later this year," said Sir Richard Branson, the British billionaire founder of Virgin Galactic.

That means the rocket motor only needs to burn for a short time period. "This means much less fuel is required \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d fuel which provides none of the toxins that are present in the solid rockets used by the space shuttle and satellite launches," Branson noted. He added that the spaceship\'s carbon footprint for each of its passengers and crew would be just a quarter of that for a return trip from London to New York. The hybrid nitrous oxide motor represents the largest of its kind in the world, designed by Virgin Galactic supplier Scaled Composites and its subcontractor SNC (Sierra Nevada Corporation). Safety features include the capability to shut down the system at any time, and permit the spaceship to glide back down for a conventional runway landing.

S'British billionaire Richard Branson \xe2\x80\x99s commercial space venture Virgin Galactic got one step closer to carrying tourists into space when a test pilot cracked the sound barrier over the Mojave Desert. For the first time, the company\'s SpaceShipTwo engaged its rocket motor and sped to Mach 1.2 and reached 56,000 feet in altitude.

Quiz: How much do you know about the federal budget cuts? The test flight took place shortly after sunrise Monday beginning on the desert runway at Mojave Air and Space Port, about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. During the test, SpaceShipTwo was taken to about 46,000 feet by a carrier aircraft and dropped like a bomb. After a short free fall, test pilots Mark Stucky and Mike Alsbury engaged the hybrid rocket motor, powered by nitrous oxide and a rubber compound, for 16 seconds, at which point SpaceShipTwo reached Mach 1.2 speed. The idea of Virgin Galactic routinely taking passengers to space this way was developed by retired maverick aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and his Mojave company, Scaled Composites. Until now, astronauts have reached space packed tight in a capsule or shuttle attached to a high-powered rocket. Instead, Virgin Galactic will use a WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft that will fly with the reusable SpaceShipTwo rocket plane under its wing to 50,000 feet, where the spaceship will separate and blast off. When the rocket motor engages, it will power the spaceship to nearly 2,500 mph and take the pilot -\xe2\x80\x93 and up to six passengers -- to the edge of space, or more than 60 miles above the Earth\'s surface. Once they reach that suborbital altitude, passengers will experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. Then they will reenter the atmosphere and glide back to the runway. The price for the experience: $200,000. Virgin Galactic, founded by Branson, hopes to make its first passenger flight sometime next year from Spaceport America in New Mexico, where the company plans to conduct routine operations. The company said it has taken about 530 reservations for the ride. The WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft, which resembles a flying catamaran because it has two fuselages, and SpaceShipTwo are still in the midst of a test-flight program that will continue in the Mojave until Virgin Galactic believes it can begin commercial operations. Virgin Galactic\'s commercial space launch system is based on Rutan\'s SpaceShipOne, the world\'s first private manned spaceship, which successfully flew a test pilot to space and back three times during 2004 to win a $10 million X-Prize purse. The prize-winning spacecraft caught the eye of Branson, who wanted to work with Rutan on a much bigger rocket ship that could send not only a pilot into space but also fare-paying passengers. The enterprise was shrouded in secrecy for years. Then in 2007, during a test of the spaceship\'s propulsion system, an explosion killed three workers and injured three others. The blast exposed the secret project and reminded the public of the risks of rocketry. The project endured and Branson has since built a 68,000-square-foot facility at the space port for a joint venture, called Spaceship Co., to mass-produce its rocket ship and carrier aircraft. It was one of the first aircraft assembly plants to be built in the region in decades.

S'The U.S. State Department on Monday publicly called on the North to release Kenneth Bae on humanitarian grounds. Spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters that Swedish diplomats, who represent U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with the North, were able to visit Bae, a U.S. citizen, on Friday. Some Americans have previously crossed the border without a visa, either knowingly or by mistake, but in this case, the official said, "This was somebody who was a tour operator who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North." The official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, says the State Department doesn\'t know the exact charges against Bae -- whom the North refers to by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho -- and is trying to clarify the matter through the Swedish Embassy. Media reports have listed the charges as plotting to overthrow the government, which carry penalties including death or life imprisonment. "In the past there have been many clear instances where American citizens are used as political bargaining chips, and our concern is that this individual not be used in this matter," the official added. North Korea plans to hold a trial against Bae, state media said Saturday, complicating tense relations between the North and the United States. Bae entered North Korea as a tourist on November 3, according to the Korean Central News Agency. According to the news agency, Bae confessed to an offense, but the KCNA did not say what it was. "He will soon be taken to the Supreme Court of the DPRK to face judgment," the news agency said, using the official name of the country, the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. The developments come amid tense relations between North Korea and South Korea and the United States. In recent weeks, the North has intensified threats against its neighbor and the United States.'

S'The move comes amid a diplomatic standoff between North Korea and the United States, and as Pyongyang has threatened to attack U.S. military bases in the Pacific and the South. A number of U.S. citizens of Korean descent have run into trouble in North Korea over the years, and Pyongyang has tried to use their detention to extract visits by high-profile American figures, most notably former President Bill Clinton. In the latest case, Kenneth Bae, 44, has been held by police since arriving in the northeastern city of Rajin on November 3. He was among a group of five tourists. "In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it," KCNA state media reported, using North Korea\'s official title of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. "His crimes were proved by evidence," it said, adding he would soon be taken to the Supreme Court "to face judgment". It did not provide further details. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was aware of reports that an American citizen would face trial in North Korea. She said representatives of the Embassy of Sweden, which acts as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in North Korea, visited Bae on Friday. South Korean rights workers said that Pyongyang may have taken issue with some of his photographs, including those of homeless North Korean children. A South Korean newspaper published by an evangelical family said he may have been carrying footage of North Korea executing defectors and dissidents. It was impossible to verify this. According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is five to 10 years of hard labor. Clinton flew to Pyongyang in 2009 and met then-leader Kim Jong-il before securing the release of two American media workers who had been charged with entering the country illegally. Former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson, who has made numerous trips to North Korea, some to seek the release of detained Americans, said he hoped the trial might help lead to Bae\'s release. Richardson delivered a letter regarding Bae to officials during a trip to North Korea in January, although he was unable to meet him. "Hopefully the conclusion of the legal process for Kenneth Bae will set the stage for a release on humanitarian grounds," Richardson told Reuters in an email. But he said Bae "should not become a pawn in the current American-North Korean friction." Tensions between North Korea and South Korea and its ally the United States have spiraled in recent weeks since the United Nations tightened sanctions after North Korea\'s third nuclear weapon test in February. The toughening of those sanctions led to Pyongyang threatening nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States. North Korea has a long record of making threats to secure concessions from the United States and South Korea, only to repeat the process later. Both the United States and the South have said in recent days that the cycle must cease. On Friday, Pyongyang rejected a call for formal talks to end a standoff that forced operations at a joint industrial complex shared by the North and South to be halted. South Korea in turn said it would pull out all its remaining workers from the Kaesong factory complex, which is just inside North Korea and is one of the North\'s few sources of ready cash. Of the 175 remaining South Korean workers, 126 workers left the factory zone on Saturday. The rest are scheduled to return on Monday. A representative of the South Korean firms at the complex urged the government to hold inter-Korean talks and to authorize their visit to North Korea on Tuesday, South Korea\'s news agency Yonhap said.

S'SEOUL, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94 An American tour operator is facing indictment in North Korea on charges that he tried to overthrow the government there, the North\xe2\x80\x99s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. The announcement about the tour operator, Kenneth Bae, an American born in South Korea, could complicate Washington\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program while avoiding confrontations that could lead to an armed conflict. Mr. Bae, from Washington State, traveled with a group of businessmen in November from Yanji, China, to the North Korean special economic zone of Rason, where he was arrested. The news report on Saturday said that the North had already finished its investigation and that Mr. Bae had admitted his guilt to charges that could draw the death penalty. South Korean human rights advocates have described Mr. Bae as a devout Christian who not only ran tours to North Korea, but was also interested in helping orphans in the Communist country. They said security officials in the North may have been offended by pictures of orphans that Mr. Bae had taken and stored in his computer. North Korea, a police state, has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington. Some were freed only after former American presidents traveled to the North. The North has been locked in a standoff with America and South Korea since it detonated a nuclear bomb in February. Some analysts say that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be chafing at his inability to shift the two countries from the tough stance they have taken, refusing to offer the North aid to relieve tensions. In January, Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, tried to see Mr. Bae during a private trip to the North, but he said he was rebuffed by the government. The Korean Central News Agency said that Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s crime had been \xe2\x80\x9cclearly substantiated by evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d The news agency did not say when Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s trial would begin. Under North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s criminal code, prosecutors are required to file a formal indictment within 10 days of the completion of an investigation. A court then rules on the case within 25 days. North Korea indicated on Saturday that Mr. Bae would not be allowed to appeal if convicted. In December, when North Korea officially confirmed Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s detention, it said he had been arrested on charges of committing \xe2\x80\x9chostile acts\xe2\x80\x9d against the North, a lesser crime than plotting to overthrow the government. In 2009, North Korea arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed \xe2\x80\x9chostile acts.\xe2\x80\x9d They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor, but were released five months later , after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North\xe2\x80\x99s capital, and met with Kim Jong-il, the leader at the time. In 2010, another American, Aijalon Mahli Gomes , was arrested and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for illegal entry and \xe2\x80\x9chostile acts.\xe2\x80\x9d He was freed when former President Jimmy Carter visited Pyongyang. Also on Saturday, 125 South Korean managers returned home from a jointly operated factory park in North Korea after Seoul decided to withdraw all its people amid continuing tensions.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell called for Bae's release at a news conference in Washington Monday. He said the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang was able to visit Bae on Friday. Sweden provides consular services for the U.S. with Pyongyang. According to state media, Bae, a tour operator of Korean descent, was arrested in early November in a special economic zone near the Chinese border. The exact nature of his alleged crimes has not been disclosed."

S'BEIJING -- North Korea said Saturday that a U.S. citizen held since November will be tried on charges of trying to overthrow the government, an offense that could carry the death penalty. The man is 44-year-old Kenneth Bae, also known by his Korean name,\xc2\xa0Pae Jun Ho, of Lynnwood, Wash. Described as a tour operator, he was arrested in the special economic zones in Rason, in the northeast of the country. "In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK [North Korea] with hostility," the official KCNA news service reported. Pyongyang has not detailed what it was that Bae allegedly did, but people\xc2\xa0 in the aid community said he was a devout Christian. Many Korean American groups work out of the North Korean border region bringing humanitarian aid into North Korea, sometimes serving as missionaries or helping defectors.\xc2\xa0 Even bringing a Bible into North Korea carries a harsh punishment.

S'By Jane Chung SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday that a Korean-American tourist, jailed by the reclusive state since late last year, will face trial for "committing crimes" against the North. The move comes amid a diplomatic standoff between North Korea and the United States , and as Pyongyang has threatened to attack U.S. military bases in the Pacific and the South. A number of U.S. citizens of Korean descent have run into trouble in North Korea over the years, and Pyongyang has tried to use their detention to extract visits by high-profile American figures, most notably former President Bill Clinton. In the latest case, Kenneth Bae , 44, has been held by police since arriving in the northeastern city of Rajin on November 3. He was among a group of five tourists. "In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it," KCNA state media reported, using North Korea\'s official title of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. "His crimes were proved by evidence," it said, adding he would soon be taken to the Supreme Court "to face judgment". It did not provide further details. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was aware of reports that an American citizen would face trial in North Korea. She said representatives of the Embassy of Sweden, which acts as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in North Korea, visited Bae on Friday. South Korean rights workers said that Pyongyang may have taken issue with some of his photographs, including those of homeless North Korean children. A South Korean newspaper published by an evangelical family said he may have been carrying footage of North Korea executing defectors and dissidents. It was impossible to verify this. According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is five to 10 years of hard labor. Clinton flew to Pyongyang in 2009 and met then-leader Kim Jong-il before securing the release of two American media workers who had been charged with entering the country illegally. Former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson, who has made numerous trips to North Korea, some to seek the release of detained Americans, said he hoped the trial might help lead to Bae\'s release. Richardson delivered a letter regarding Bae to officials during a trip to North Korea in January, although he was unable to meet him. "Hopefully the conclusion of the legal process for Kenneth Bae will set the stage for a release on humanitarian grounds," Richardson told Reuters in an email. But he said Bae "should not become a pawn in the current American-North Korean friction." Tensions between North Korea and South Korea and its ally the United States have spiraled in recent weeks since the United Nations tightened sanctions after North Korea\'s third nuclear weapon test in February. The toughening of those sanctions led to Pyongyang threatening nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States. North Korea has a long record of making threats to secure concessions from the United States and South Korea, only to repeat the process later. Both the United States and the South have said in recent days that the cycle must cease. On Friday, Pyongyang rejected a call for formal talks to end a standoff that forced operations at a joint industrial complex shared by the North and South to be halted. South Korea in turn said it would pull out all its remaining workers from the Kaesong factory complex, which is just inside North Korea and is one of the North\'s few sources of ready cash. Of the 175 remaining South Korean workers, 126 workers left the factory zone on Saturday. The rest are scheduled to return on Monday. A representative of the South Korean firms at the complex urged the government to hold inter-Korean talks and to authorize their visit to North Korea on Tuesday, South Korea\'s news agency Yonhap said.

S'SEOUL \xe2\x80\x94 North Korea said Saturday that a detained American allegedly tried to \xe2\x80\x9ctopple\xe2\x80\x9d its government and will soon be put on trial, a potential complication as Washington tries to ramp down tensions stemming from Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s recent weapons tests and threats of nuclear attack. Kenneth Bae, a tour operator from Washington state, is the sixth American detained by the North since 2009, but he faces more serious charges than the others. The North used several previous cases as bargaining chips with the United States, drawing rescue-mission visits from former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The North gave no specifics about its evidence against Bae, saying only that his crimes were \xe2\x80\x9cclearly substantiated.\xe2\x80\x9d In November, Bae traveled in a small group to the North Korean port city of Rajin, a special economic zone that caters to foreign investors. There, he was arrested by authorities. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tried to negotiate Bae\xe2\x80\x99s release during a trip to Pyongyang in January. But North Korean officials would not let Richardson meet with Bae, Richardson said \xe2\x80\x94 although they did reassure him that Bae\xe2\x80\x99s health was good. They also told Richardson that Bae had been allowed to meet with members of the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which occasionally acts on behalf of the United States because Washington does not have diplomatic ties with the North. In an interview with CNN after his trip, Richardson said Bae was being held \xe2\x80\x9cvery far away from Pyongyang, in the northern part of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Since Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s visit, tensions between North Korea and the United States have spiked.

S'Sunil Tripathi\'s family had been searching for him since mid-March with help from the FBI and fellow Brown students. His sister said he left his phone, wallet and other belongings in his apartment near campus and simply disappeared. PROVIDENCE, R.I. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 A body pulled from waters off a Providence park was that of a 22-year-old Brown University student missing since last month, the Rhode Island medical examiner\'s office said Thursday. Sunil Tripathi was identified through a forensic dental exam, but a cause of death has not been determined, said Dara Chadwick, a spokeswoman for the state health department. The announcement put an end to the mystery of Tripathi\'s disappearance, which became doubly painful for his family when amateur online sleuths wrongly identified him as a possible suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. Tripathi\'s family, of Bryn Mawr, Pa., said it was overcome with grief but grateful for the outpouring of support relatives got over the last month. "As we carry indescribable grief, we also feel incredible gratitude," the Tripathi family said in a statement on a Facebook page set up to help find Tripathi, who went by Sunny. "To each one of you - from our hometown to many distant lands - we extend our thanks for the words of encouragement, for your thoughts, for your hands, for your prayers, and for the love you have so generously shared." Tripathi\'s body was found Tuesday by members of the Brown crew team off of India Point Park and was brought to shore by its coach, Providence Police Cmdr. Thomas Oates said. He said the body had been in the water for "some time." Tripathi\'s family had been searching for him since mid-March with help from the FBI and fellow Brown students. His sister, Sangeeta, said he left his phone, wallet and other belongings in his apartment near campus and simply disappeared. He was on leave from the Ivy League school, where he was studying philosophy, and had been going through a difficult time, she said. Last week, speculation swirled on Twitter and the website Reddit that Tripathi was the second of two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings because some thought he resembled one of the people in photos released by the FBI. That person turned out to be 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, authorities said. Reddit later apologized to Tripathi\'s family for fueling "online witch hunts and dangerous speculation which spiraled into very negative consequences for innocent parties." Tripathi\'s family responded to the speculation in a Facebook post that read: "A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past 12 hours. We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil." The family said in its statement Thursday that the last month "has changed our lives forever, and we hope it will change yours too." The family went on: "Take care of one another. Be gentle, be compassionate. Be open to letting someone in when it is you who is faltering. Lend your hand. We need it. The world needs it." Brown President Christina H. Paxson sent a message to the campus community Thursday, saying Tripathi - the brother of two Brown graduates- would be remembered for his "gentle demeanor and generous spirit." She described him as an accomplished saxophonist and a "serious, thoughtful, intellectually curious student and a brilliant writer."

S'SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d A California woman faces attempted murder charges after police say she tried to sneak orange juice bottles spiked with a lethal amount of rubbing alcohol inside a Starbucks. San Jose Police arrested Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, late Monday. A customer reported seeing the woman take two bottles of orange juice from her bag and place them in an open-air refrigerated display case at a Starbucks in San Jose around 3:45 p.m., Sgt. Jason Dwyer said Tuesday. When the customer told a store manager what he saw, Behbehanian fled. A store employee followed Behbehanian to the parking lot and jotted down her license plate number as she drove off. Other employees called 911 after noticing the bottles had a toxic smell, Dwyer said. Firefighters on the scene tested the contents and determined that the bottles contained a "lethal quantity" of isopropyl rubbing alcohol mixed with the juice, Dwyer said. No one drank from the bottles, said Dwyer, who praised the customer\'s quick actions. "This person was heads-up enough and reported suspicious activity," Dwyer said. "I think that person saved lives by doing that." Officers tracked down Behbehanian Monday night at her San Jose home located about five miles away from the store. She was placed into custody on suspicion of attempted murder and felony poisoning, Dwyer said. Police are still looking for a motive. "We don\'t know if she has done this before or if she had plans to do this again," Dwyer said. "We have no reason to believe that there are other coffee shops with similar dangers." Dwyer declined to say how much rubbing alcohol was actually in the bottles, but he said it was sufficient for police to charge Behbehanian with attempted murder. The Starbucks store in San Jose was closed after Monday\'s incident but reopened the next morning, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said Tuesday. "We\'re immensely grateful to the vigilant customer who immediately did the right thing by notifying our store partners who immediately pulled the juice from the shelves and quickly notified the authorities," Hutson said. As a precaution, Hutson said that the Starbucks store in San Jose pulled all of its remaining juices from the open-air refrigerator and destroyed them. Other Starbucks nearby were also alerted and told to check all their juice bottles to make sure none of its seals were broken. Behbehanian could make her first appearance in court as soon as Thursday, authorities said. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

S'San Jose, Calif., police say a local woman with no criminal record replaced orange juice bottles in a Starbucks cold box with tainted ones \xe2\x80\x93 and they are puzzled about why she may have done it. Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, will face\xc2\xa0charges of suspicion of poisoning and attempted murder, police said. The Starbucks, located on the 6000 Block of Snell Avenue in South San Jose, Calif., was evacuated Monday evening after a customer spotted a woman switching bottles in the cold box at the front of the store with those in her bag, according to police. As the witness was notifying Starbucks employees of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s suspicious activity, police said, the suspect apparently overheard the conversation and fled the scene abruptly.\xc2\xa0A Starbucks employee was able to record the license plate of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s car.

"According to our San Jose firefighters that were on scene and the fire captain there -- they really are the experts there -- it was a lethal dose," he said. Behbehanian was arrested Monday after a customer spotted her allegedly pulling out two bottles of orange juice from a bag and putting them in the display case, he said. The customer reported it to employees, according to police. The customer also got a license plate number, and investigators later traced the plate to Behbehanian\'s residence, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said. The employees immediately pulled the bottles of orange juice from the display case, and the store was evacuated until firefighters could determine the contents of the bottles, Hutson said. The store employees pulled all the remaining juices from the cold case and destroyed them, he said. Nearby Starbucks stores were also notified of the incident and told to check the juice bottles. Hutson said the coffee chain was "immensely grateful" to the customer who alerted employees to the tainted juice bottles. Dwyer would not comment on the evidence in the case nor a possible motive, saying authorities were "still very much in investigative mode." He did say the bottles were opened rather than injected by a syringe.'

S'On-time performance of airlines at the nation\'s biggest airports dropped 9 percentage points Monday after hundreds of air traffic controllers were furloughed by budget cuts. East Coast airports felt most of the pain, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Staff shortages at air traffic towers were expected to cause more delays Tuesday in Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas. "Travelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather-related issues," the agency said in a statement. Frustrated lawmakers in Washington criticized FAA administrators, saying budget cuts resulting from the so-called sequester could have been made without furloughing air traffic controllers. "Not all government spending is created equally, and so this morning I\'m calling on the Obama administration and the FAA to be smarter and more transparent about the sequester," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor. The union representing the nation\'s 15,000 air traffic controllers said the overtime the FAA is paying to deal with the staff shortages is erasing any savings from the furloughs. "It\'s simple math \xe2\x80\x94 furloughing controllers earning base while paying others base pay plus an additional 50% will not result in savings," the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. said in a statement. But FAA officials said they were only approving overtime pay on a limited basis. The on-time rate for airlines at the nation\'s largest airports dropped to an average of about 73% on Monday, compared with 82% the previous Monday, according to Flightstats, a website that monitors airline performance rates. On-time rates dropped even more at airports in New York and Florida, with LaGuardia Airport reporting a 47% rate and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport at 51%, according to the website. Some delays in New York, however, were attributed to strong winds. At Los Angeles International Airport, where some travelers reported delays of up to an hour, the average on-time performance was 78% on Monday, about the same rate as the previous Monday, according to Flightstats. The FAA said it delayed 1,200 flights Monday because of staff shortages \xe2\x80\x94 about three times as many as Sunday. The FAA attributed 1,400 other delays to severe weather and other factors, such as airport maintenance work. hugo.martin@latimes.com'

Apart from the furloughs, the F.A.A. counted more than 1,400 delays for weather and other reasons.

The staffing problems are mostly in radar rooms, not control towers, it added. There are 30,000 to 35,000 commercial flights a day in the United States. Some travelers were delayed a few minutes, but others missed connections and were delayed for hours. Some later flights were delayed or canceled because the airplanes they were to use had arrived so late.

S'Sequestration became a reality to the broad public in airports across the country this week, and on Friday both Congress and the White House caved in to pressure from tens of thousands of airline passengers angered by flight delays. The lawmakers and the Obama administration, creators of the across-the-board funding cuts, found a path around their own creation, approving legislation to end the daily furloughs of 1,500 air traffic controllers that caused long delays at several major airports. The House voted 361 to 41 Friday in favor of a bill that had won unanimous support in the Senate, and White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Obama would sign it. With Congress headed home for a week, the question becomes whether lawmakers will return emboldened to keep tinkering with sequestration, giving more federal agencies the flexibility to make required budget cuts in ways that do not call for furloughs or unpopular service cuts. The White House had pushed for Congress to eliminate sequestration, but its hand was forced Friday. Now, it faces the risk that if Congress continues to mandate small spending changes that reduce the high-profile and painful consequences of the cuts, the entire sequestration process will become more palatable to the public. House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) hinted at that possibility after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s vote. \xe2\x80\x9cThis legislation ensures beyond a shadow of a doubt that the agency now has more than enough capacity to end air traffic controller furloughs, stop the pain for the traveling public and protect the economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Shuster said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout giving the FAA any additional funding.\xe2\x80\x9d The Federal Aviation Administration furloughs may have been the most visible effect of the $85 billion in spending cuts that kicked in across the government on March 1 after a gridlocked Congress failed to reach agreement on a broad plan to reduce the federal deficit. The cuts had been designed to be so painful and indiscriminate \xe2\x80\x94 mindless, even \xe2\x80\x94 that even a partisan Congress would not allow them to happen. Republicans see the changes in FAA spending ordered by the new legislation as a model for future adjustments to the cuts. They are pushing legislation to give the administration more flexibility to administer the sequester while leaving in place the overall spending reductions the law requires. But the White House, which seemed taken by surprise by the bill\xe2\x80\x99s swift passage, resumed the push to end sequestration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is that this is just a Band-Aid solution,\xe2\x80\x9d Carney said. \xe2\x80\x9cCongress should do the responsible thing and stop dealing with these issues from crisis to crisis, and simply engage in a discussion about how we can eliminate the sequester entirely through balanced deficit reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d The furlough of 1,500 air traffic controllers each day to achieve $200\xc2\xa0million in savings from the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s budget became a test of wills between Congress and the administration.

S"A week after federal officials launched job furloughs at air traffic control towers, the controllers are back on a regular work schedule -- and airline delays are now caused primarily by severe weather. The number of delays over the week averaged about 5,800 per day, according to a report from Flightstats.com, a website that monitors flight delays. The greatest number of delays came last Monday, April 22, when slightly more than 7,000 flights were delayed, according to Flightstats. On Sunday, the nation's airports reported 4,800 delays, according to the website. By Monday morning, the only significant delays reported were attributed to heavy cloud cover at Philadelphia International Airport. To cut about $636 million from its budget, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered air traffic controllers to take one day off of work for every two-week period, reducing its workforce by about 10%. The furloughs caused takeoff delays of hundreds of planes when congestion in the skies grew heavy. The airports that endured the most delays were LaGuardia, Newark Liberty, Los Angeles International, John F. Kennedy and O'Hare International. A bill approved by the House on Friday and sent to the president allowed the FAA to transfer $253 million from infrastructure improvement funds to put furloughed air traffic controllers back to work. Senate officials said the bill also prevented closures at 149 control towers, many in rural areas, that rely on contract air controllers. The FAA announced Saturday that it had suspended all furloughs and returned to normal operations Sunday.

S'Facing the prospect of at least another week of widespread flight delays, the House on Friday passed legislation to ease up the sequester\'s impact on the Federal Aviation Administration. The measure passed, and now goes to President Obama for his signature, in spite of grumblings from Democrats that Congress is alleviating the impact of sequestration on America\'s powerful air travelers while failing to address the strain it has had on programs like Meals on Wheels, Head Start and federal unemployment insurance. "We ought not to be mitigating the sequester\'s effect on just one segment when children, the sick, the military and many other groups" are ignored, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said on the House floor. "Let\'s deal with all the adverse consequences of sequester." The House passed the bill by a vote of 361 to 41, granting the FAA authority to use up to $253 million from various accounts to avoid reduced staffing and operations through Sept. 30. Because of the sequester -- the $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts that went into effect in March -- the FAA on Sunday began furloughs of 47,000 employees, leading to flight significant delays. The bill passed Friday should avert those furloughs, as well as the closures of small airport towers. Congress faced pressure to act on the matter this week, before it leaves for a week-long recess. The Senate passed the legislation by unanimous consent late Thursday night after after hours of intense, closed-door negotiations. Obama administration officials participated in the talks, even though Mr. Obama has said he wants to replace the sequester with a comprehensive plan for deficit reduction that includes both new tax revenues and spending cuts. "The president believes it\'s good news to eliminate this problem," White House Spokesman Jay Carney said Friday as the House was voting on the bill. However, he added, Mr. Obama "believes this is a band-aid covering a massive wound to the economy" In response to a disappointing economic report released by the Commerce Department Friday, Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted that the sequestration is slowing down the economic recovery. "These arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation\'s future competitiveness," he wrote in a White House blog post. "The Administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work, like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing." The GOP-led House has passed legislation to replace the sequester with other spending cuts, but they\'ve resisted the Democrats\' call for a "balanced approach" that would replace it with spending cuts and tax reforms. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., sent a letter to House Republicans Friday morning casting the FAA bill as a "victory" over the Democrats\' call for more tax revenues. "Consider that the Democrats opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases," he wrote. "By the first of this week Senator Reid proposed replacing the whole sequester with phony war savings. And by last night, Senate Democrats were adopting our targeted "cut this, not that" approach.

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 The government is moving the morning-after pill over the counter but only those 15 and older can buy it -- an attempt to find middle ground just days before a court-imposed deadline to lift all age restrictions on the emergency contraceptive. Today, Plan B One-Step is sold behind pharmacy counters, and buyers must prove they\'re 17 or older to buy it without a prescription. Tuesday\'s decision by the Food and Drug Administration lowers the age limit and will allow the pill to sit on drugstore shelves next to spermicides or other women\'s health products and condoms -- but anyone who wants to buy it must prove their age at the cash register. Some contraceptive advocates called the move promising. "This decision is a step in the right direction for increased access to a product that is a safe and effective method of preventing unintended pregnancies," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. "It\'s also a decision that moves us closer to these critical availability decisions being based on science, not politics." But earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman of New York blasted the Obama administration for imposing the age-17 limit, saying it had let election-year politics trump science and was making it hard for women of any age to obtain the emergency contraception in time. He ordered an end to the age restrictions by Monday. The women\'s group that sued over the age limits said Tuesday\'s action is not enough, and it will continue the court fight. Lowering the age limit "may reduce delays for some young women but it does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. The FDA said the Plan B One-Step will be packaged with a product code that prompts the cashier to verify a customer\'s age. Anyone who can\'t provide such proof as a driver\'s license, birth certificate or passport wouldn\'t be allowed to complete the purchase. "These are daunting and sometimes insurmountable hoops women are forced to jump through in time-sensitive circumstances, and we will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women," Northup said. Half the nation\'s pregnancies every year are unintended, and doctors\' groups say more access to morning-after pills could cut those numbers. The pills contain higher doses of regular contraceptives, and if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 percent. The FDA had been poised to lift all age limits and let Plan B sell over-the-counter in late 2011, when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in an unprecedented move, overruled her own scientists. Sebelius said some girls as young as 11 are physically capable of bearing children, but shouldn\'t be able to buy the pregnancy-preventing pill on their own. President Barack Obama supported Sebelius\' move and a spokesman said earlier this month that the president\'s position hadn\'t changed. The FDA said Tuesday\'s decision was independent of the court case. Instead, after the Obama administration\'s 2011 action, Plan B maker Teva Women\'s Health had filed a new application with the age-15 compromise.'

S'This move comes just weeks after a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, ordered the FDA to make the morning-after birth control pill available to women of any age, without a prescription. Tuesday\'s FDA announcement, which pertains to an application from Teva Women\'s Health, Inc., is not related to that, the FDA said. "The FDA\'s approval of Teva\'s current application for Plan B One-Step is independent of that litigation and this decision is not intended to address the judge\'s ruling," the FDA said in a statement. In early April, the U.S. Justice Department indicated an appeal of the Brooklyn judge\'s order was under consideration. "The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly," department spokeswoman Allison Price said. According to the new FDA decision, Plan B One-Step will now be labeled to reflect that proof of age is required to purchase it, and it cannot be sold where age cannot be verified. The packaging will include a product code that prompts the cashier to ask and verify the age of the customer. The product will be available in retail outlets with pharmacies, but the pill can be sold during non-pharmacy hours, too. "While we fully support this expansion of access to birth control, we continue to believe that the administration should lift all unnecessary restrictions to emergency contraception, consistent with the prevailing science and medicine," Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said Tuesday in a statement. The FDA decision does not pertain to the two other emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the United States. Plan B is available from generic manufacturers over-the-counter for women 17 and older and Ella is available by prescription only, for all ages, and prevents pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. "Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States," said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement. "The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease." None of these products protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Controversy surrounding emergency contraception in the United States has lasted more than just one morning. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States. Opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug. In 2011, Teva Women\'s Health Inc., maker of Plan B One-Step, had asked the FDA to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA\'s recommendation in 2011, saying, "I do not believe enough data were presented to support the application." She mandated requiring a prescription for girls under 17. In early April, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman said in his order , "The decisions of the Secretary with respect to Plan B One-Step and that of the FDA with respect to the Citizen Petition, which it had no choice but to deny, were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable." Korman\'s order sparked praise among supporters of the morning-after pill for all ages, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had launched a relevant lawsuit. Nancy Northup, the center\'s president and CEO, said in a statement about that order: "This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods." But other groups, including the Family Research Council, expressed concerns about Korman\'s order. "There is a real danger that Plan B may be given to young girls, under coercion or without their consent. The involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls. However, today\'s ruling removes these common-sense protections," Anna Higgins, director of the organization\'s Center for Human Dignity, said in a statement. The FDA approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in Plan B is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary, or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm. If there has been fertilization, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus, the morning-after pill will not work. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. A 2012 study in the journal Pediatrics found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception, including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription, and who can take it in general. The morning-after pill goes for about $50, said Susannah Baruch, interim president and CEO of Reproductive Health Technologies Project.'

S'Women and girls age 15 and over will soon be able to buy emergency contraception without a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it was approving Plan B One-Step, also known as the morning-after pill, to be sold in the retail aisle next to other over-the-counter medications. Customers will not have to ask a pharmacist for it. FDA officials say the announcement is unrelated to a federal judge\'s order earlier this month, which gave the agency 30 days to make the pill available to all girls and women without a prescription, regardless of age. Until now, women have had to ask a pharmacist for emergency contraception. Those under 17 could get the pill only with a prescription. In his April 5th ruling,U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman noted that emergency contraception has been shown to be extremely safe, and that the FDA\'s age limits were arbitrary. "FDA has engaged in intolerable delays," Korman said, amounting to an "administration agency filibuster." Korman\'s ruling was in response to a lawsuit by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to expand access to emergency contraception, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within three days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Plan B One-Step, a single pill containing a hormone found in birth control pills, sold by Teva Women\'s Health, does not terminate an existing pregnancy and does not harm a developing fetus, the FDA said. About half of pregnancies are unintended, studies show. FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said the Tuesday approval "is independent of the judge\'s ruling and is not intended to address it." In an interview with USA TODAY\'s Editorial Board last week, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the agency had not yet decided how to respond to the judge\'s order. Jefferson said the Department of Justice handles litigation, and said all questions about the judge\'s order should be referred to that agency. Now, customers will be able to buy Plan B One-Step just as they would purchase condoms. But girls will have to show an ID to prove their age, the FDA said. "The FDA is under a federal court order that makes it crystal clear that emergency contraception must be made available over the counter, without restriction to women of all ages by next Monday," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. "Lowering the age restriction to 15 for over-the-counter access to Plan B One-Step may reduce delays for some young women \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but it does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification or after the pharmacy gates have been closed for the night or weekend. These are daunting and sometimes insurmountable hoops women are forced to jump through in time-sensitive circumstances, and we will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women." Emergency contraception has had a long history with the FDA. The drug was first approved in 1993. In 2011, the FDA was about to approve an application from its manufacturer, Teva Women\'s Health, to sell it over the counter. President Obama expressed concerns, however, and Secretary of Health and Human Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA. When its application to sell Plan B One-Step over-the-counter without age restrictions was rejected, Teva submitted a new application, requesting approval for those 15 and up, the FDA said. That application, asking for approval for those 15 and up, was filed before the judge\'s ruling, Jefferson said. At the time of the judge\'s ruling, the Family Research Council\'s Anna Higgins said, "Making Plan B available for girls under the age of 17 without a prescription flies in the face of medical information and sound judgment." Higgins also expressed concern that the over-the-counter availability of Plan B for girls of any age would put many at further risk of sexually transmitted infections. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America officials praised the FDA\'s decision, although the group also encouraged the FDA to lift all restrictions on emergency contraception, as mandated by the court. "While there are still practical questions to resolve, this is an important step forward to expand access to emergency contraception and for preventing unintended pregnancy," Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said. " This decision will eliminate some of the biggest barriers and hurdles that women face in getting emergency contraception when they need it, which means many more women will be able to prevent unintended pregnancy." Other forms of emergency contraception have been approved. A two-dose version of Plan B is available generically and available to women 17 and up without a prescription. It requires a prescription for girls under age 17. Another version, sold as Ella, is sold only with a prescription and is approved to prevent pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.'

That decision, which takes effect immediately, represents a compromise on the politically charged issue of access to emergency contraception , which has pitted conservative and anti- abortion groups against advocates for women\xe2\x80\x99s health and reproductive rights. The Justice Department is most likely weighing not only the substance of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, but also the precedent the ruling would set in countermanding an order by a White House cabinet member, Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services. In 2011, she decided the pill would be available without prescription only to those 17 and older, despite the F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s finding that it was safe and effective and should be available without any age restrictions. She said the pill had not been studied for safety in girls as young as 11. It was the first time the F.D.A. had been publicly overruled by a cabinet secretary. After her order, the pill\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer submitted an amended application seeking access for 15-year-olds. On Tuesday, a Health and Human Services Department official said that Ms. Sebelius was comfortable with the F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve that application. Besides lowering the age restriction, the new rule addresses concerns of women who were unable to get the pill if their drugstore\xe2\x80\x99s pharmacy counter happened to be closed. Now, Plan B One-Step will be available in drugstore aisles where family planning or women\xe2\x80\x99s health products are displayed. The packaging will include a product code that, when scanned by a cashier, will indicate that the customer\xe2\x80\x99s proof of age is required. To try to prevent theft, the manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has arranged for each box to have a security tag, the drug agency said. Margaret A. Hamburg, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement that data proved that 15-year-olds \xe2\x80\x9cwere able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease .\xe2\x80\x9d The agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision applies only to Plan B One-Step, which is a one-pill dose, not to the two-pill generic versions, because there is not enough data to show the two-dose versions can be used responsibly by younger teenagers without the intervention of a health provider, said an F.D.A. spokeswoman, Erica Jefferson. Marty Berndt, a vice president and general manager for Teva, called the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9ca significant milestone for women.\xe2\x80\x9d But it did not completely satisfy either side of the emergency contraception debate. Anna Higgins , the director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council, accused the administration of trying to \xe2\x80\x9cplacate both sides,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9callowing this to young teens will be something that we will remain very concerned about.\xe2\x80\x9d Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, called the decision \xe2\x80\x9can important step forward\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cwill eliminate some of the biggest barriers and hurdles that women face in getting emergency contraception.\xe2\x80\x9d But Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit that Judge Korman ruled on, said the decision on Tuesday was unsatisfactory. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'

S'The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Plan B One-Step for women aged 15 and older without a prescription. The decision, which was announced on Tuesday , was in regards to an amended application submitted by Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. The company first sought approval to market Plan B One-Step to all females of reproductive age, but changed their initial appeal for approval for those 15 and older. Play Video Plan B One-Step, also known as the "morning after pill," is a form of emergency contraception that can reduce the chance of pregnancy after a person has engaged in unprotected sex, meaning they did not use another form of birth control or their chosen method did not work. There are currently three types of emergency contraception available for sale in the U.S.: Plan B One-Step, Plan B, and ella. Plan B is a two-pill system that requires a prescription for those who are under 17. Ella also requires a prescription, regardless of age. Plan B One-Step does not stop pregnancy if a woman is already pregnant, nor has any scientific evidence shown that it will harm a fetus that already exists. The single-dose pill works best if taken within three days after sexual intercourse. "Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States," Dr. FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, said in a press release. "The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease." Plan B One-Step will now bear a label that reads "not for sale to those under 15 years of age *proof of age required* not for sale where age cannot be verified." The product code will prompt cashiers to ask for proof of age when a person attempts to purchase the product, and it will not be sold to anyone who cannot provide proof of their age. Security tags will also be placed on the products to deter thieves. Plan B One-Step will be sold in retail outlets with an onsite pharmacy as part of the agreement, but it can be sold regardless if the pharmacy is open or not. The FDA considered actual use studies and label comprehension data submitted by Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. when making their decision. The agency determined that women 15 and older knew the product could not be used regularly and would not protect them from sexually transmitted diseases. Earlier in April 2013, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered that the FDA had to make contraceptives available to females of all ages, calling the requirement for a prescription "arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable." However, the pending request from Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. at that time only asked for the prescription ban to be lifted for women aged 15 or older. "This decision is a step in the right direction for increased access to a product that is a safe and effective method of preventing unintended pregnancies," Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement to CBS News. "It\'s also a decision that moves us closer to these critical availability decisions being based on science, not politics. Plan B is an essential part of a woman\'s basic health care and I will continue to push for more information from FDA and HHS on the practical application of this policy while also working to ensure that access is based on science, safety, and efficacy."'
