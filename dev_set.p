p624
aS"A cornerstone of their case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson's death."
p625
aS'The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary.'
p626
aS'We want to remind him what is expected of him.'
p627

aS'"He kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest, darkest secret.'

aS'" Putnam said Jackson family members will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening.'

aS'"People have responsibility for their personal choices.'

p666
aS'Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders, in arguing for the judge to allow Erk\'s testimony, said when "This Is It" tickets went on sale in March 2009, there was the "highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world.'

aS'But AEG lawyer Sabrina Strong called it "very speculative" that Jackson would have even finished the 50 London shows before dying.'

aS'The Jacksons will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of Las Vegas shows, endorsements, a clothing line and movies.'

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh (AP) -- The fugitive owner of an illegally constructed building that collapsed and killed at least 377 people was captured by commandos as he tried to flee into India. At the disaster site, meanwhile, fire broke out in the rubble and forced authorities to suspend the search for survivors temporarily.'

aS'Many of those killed worked at clothing factories in the building, known as the Rana Plaza , and the collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth $20 billion annually, supplies global retailers and is a mainstay of the economy.'
p1058
aS'The fire that broke out late Sunday night sent smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and halted some of the rescue efforts \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d including a bid to free a woman who was found trapped in the rubble.'
p1059
aS'The blaze was caused by sparks as rescuers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescuers were injured in the fire, he said. It forced them to retreat while firefighters frantically hosed down the flames.'
p1060
aS'Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed the trapped woman, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Rescue workers had delayed the use of heavy equipment for several hours in the hope that she could be extricated from the rubble first. But with the woman presumed dead, they began using heavy equipment around midnight.'
p1061
aS'An exhausted and disheveled Rana was brought before reporters briefly at the Dhaka headquarters of the commando team, the Rapid Action Battalion.'
p1062
aS'Wearing a printed shirt, Rana was sweating as two security officers held him by his arms. A security official helped him to drink water after he gestured he was thirsty. He did not speak during the 10-minute appearance, and he is likely to be handed over to police, who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours.'
p1063
aS'A small-time political operative from the ruling Awami League party, Rana had been on the run since the building collapsed Wednesday. He last appeared in public Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared in the building.'
p1064
aS'Witnesses said Rana assured tenants, including five garment factories , that the building was safe. Police, however, ordered an evacuation. A bank and some first-floor shops closed, but managers of the garment factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts.'
p1065
aS'Hours later, the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete. Local authorities said the construction permit was issued for a five-story building, not the eight floors that were built.'
p1066
aS"Rana's arrest was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader."
p1067
aS"On Saturday, police arrested three owners of two factories. Also detained were Rana's wife and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for the building design. Local TV stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank accounts of the owners of all five garment factories in the Rana Plaza."
p1068
aS"A garment manufacturers' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside when it fell. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for."
p1069
aS'Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said the next phase of the search involved the heavy equipment such as hydraulic cranes that were brought to the disaster site Sunday. Searchers had been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels, he said.'
p1070
aS'The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. "We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones," Suhrawardy said.'
p1071
aS'In a rare bit of good news, a female worker was pulled out alive Sunday. Rescuer Hasan Akbari said when he tried to extricate a man next to the woman, "he said his body was being torn apart. So I had to let go. But God willing, we will be able to rescue him with more help very soon."'
p1072
aS'The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands.'
p1073
aS'The death toll surpassed a fire five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed in Bangladesh.'
p1074
aS'Its garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade.'
p1075
aS'Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year.'
p1076
aS'The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers.'
p1077
aS"Britain's Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them."
p1078
aS'Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorized to be made in the facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorized production.'

S'NEW DELHI, India \xe2\x80\x93- The owner of a collapsed building in Bangladesh was arrested Sunday near the Indian border\xc2\xa0as the death toll rose to at least 370 in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s worst garment industry disaster. With more than 800 people still missing and time running out, rescue officials fear the number could rise sharply.'
p1222
aS'[Updated 11:45 a.m. PDT, April 28: Fire broke out in the collapsed building late Sunday night local time, Associated Press reported, forcing a halt to rescue efforts as smoke poured from the stacked slabs of concrete. A rescuer told AP that the fire began when workers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach a trapped woman, and sparks ignited the wreckage. The extent of the fire was not immedately clear. ]'
p1223
aS'Sohel Rana, landlord of the pancaked Rana Plaza, was trying to flee the country when he was detained in the border town of Benapole, police said. Rana is reportedly an official with the ruling party who went into hiding soon after he was rescued from the wreckage of his own building. Local news photos showed him wearing a black and white printed shirt as he was taken into custody by two men in plain clothes.'
p1224
aS'"He has been arrested and will be tried," Bangladesh\'s deputy home minister, Shamsul Haque Tuku, told reporters.'
p1225
aS'Rana Plaza, housing five apparel factories supplying western brands, a shopping plaza and a bank branch, developed cracks Tuesday, according to local media reports. Police condemned the eight-story building, but some factory owners reportedly ordered workers back to their sewing machines just hours before the massive structure collapsed. Reports said an illegal ninth story was under construction.'
p1226
aS'Disaster Management Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali said Sunday the structure didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet building code requirements, was never approved by the government and was built on a wetland using substandard construction materials. The revelations are likely to fan public outrage that\xe2\x80\x99s been burning for days.'
p1227
aS'In addition to Rana, authorities have arrested three factory owners and two government engineers in the growing national crisis.\xc2\xa0 Local media reported that Rana\xe2\x80\x99s mother died of a heart attack on Saturday evening.'
p1228
aS'Meanwhile, fewer people are being pulled out alive with each passing day. The five rescued Sunday compared with approximately two dozen on Saturday and more than 70 on Friday.'
p1229
aS'"The chances of finding people alive are dimming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hassan Sohrawardi, the army official coordinating the rescue operation. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we have to step up our rescue operation to save any valuable life we can."'
p1230
aS'Local television footage showed large cranes parked outside the building. Authorities initially announced they would suspend the rescue operation and start removing the debris at the 72-hour mark, but angry relatives forced them to continue searching. As the stench of decaying bodies grows, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before the focus shifts to a cleanup operation, analysts said.'
p1231
aS'Nine more survivors were spotted under massive pieces of concrete Sunday, spurring an operation to reach them. So far, 2,440 people have been pulled out alive, Dhaka\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Star newspaper reports.'
p1232
aS'The roads were relatively quiet Sunday, with protests limited to a few blocked highways. This followed days of demonstrations and clashes between police and angry garment workers who burned factories, smashed cars and wrecked shops. Opposition forces have called for a national strike Thursday to protest the disaster.'
p1233
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the time for agitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday on a day in which she visited hospitals and promised aid in a bid to stem the civil and political fallout. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the time to stand beside other people. Vandalism on the streets is not acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
p1234
aS'Bangladesh has seen a string of fires and collapses affecting the textile and apparel industry, which accounts for 80% of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s $24 billion in exports. The poor safety record, low wages and concerns over worker safety have spotlighted the human price paid for inexpensive western clothing.'

aS"After roughly 16 hours of questioning, investigators were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, the four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him."
p1613
aS'It is unclear whether any of this will matter in court since the FBI says Tsarnaev confessed to a witness and U.S. officials said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene.'
p1614
aS'But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering.'
p1615
aS'Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment."'
p1616
aS'Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said.'
p1617
aS'The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough.'
p1618
aS'The U.S. officials who discussed the terrorist database and other details of the investigation are in addition to those who discussed the Miranda warning. They were close to the investigation and insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters.'
p1619
aS'Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt.'

aS'AP Photo: vk.com. Boston bombing suspect unarmed: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has reportedly remained quiet since being read his constitutional rights.'
p1621
aS'Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured.'
p1622
aS'More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects.'
p1623
aS'Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as "two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis."'
p1624
aS'Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group.'
p1625
aS'Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.'
p1626
aS'Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty.'
p1627
aS'Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.'
p1628
aS'That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that."'
p1629
aS'Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.'
p1630
aS'The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.'
p1631
aS'Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, "I\'m not going to talk about that."'
p1632
aS'Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report.'
p1633
aS'"Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him." Schwartz said. "And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn\'t change anything for me."'
p1634
aS"The suspects' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan's body back to Russia."
p1635
aS"In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers' parents, hoping to gain more information."
p1636
aS"Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade."

p2423
aS'Mr. Branson founded Virgin Galactic eight and a half years ago, capitalizing on the success of the first privately financed spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, to carry people above an altitude of 62 miles, considered the edge of outer space. SpaceShipOne had only two seats, and, in its flights, carried only the pilot. Mr. Branson hired Burt Rutan, SpaceShipOne\xe2\x80\x99s designer, and Mr. Rutan\xe2\x80\x99s company, Scaled Composites, to build a larger version called SpaceShipTwo with seats for six passengers, each of whom would pay $200,000 to reach space. He predicted that commercial flights would begin in 2007.'
p2424
aS'That goal was delayed by technological challenges, including an explosion during a propulsion test at Scaled Composites in 2007 that killed three workers.'
p2425
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough 8.5 years, trying to get everything right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Branson said. \xe2\x80\x9cToday really was almost the culmination of all that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
p2426
aS'Over the past two and a half years, SpaceShipTwo has made a series of tests as a glider. On Monday morning, with Mr. Branson among the spectators, a carrier aircraft lofted SpaceShipTwo to a height of 47,000 feet before letting it go. This time, it did more than glide.'
p2427
aS'The engine roared for 16 seconds, accelerating SpaceShipTwo to Mach 1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 1.2 times the speed of sound \xe2\x80\x93 and pushing it to an altitude of 55,000 feet, about 10.5 miles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see very, very clearly the plume of flames coming out the back of the spaceship,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Branson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see it speeding up through the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d'

aS'"I think he is immensely brave. I think it\'s a shame in this day and age he has to be immensely brave, but he is," Amaechi told the AP. "He\'s going to be a remarkable and eloquent spokesperson for what it is to be a decent, authentic human being -- never mind just for gay people."'
p3019

p3034
aS'Former President Clinton said: "Jason\'s announcement today is an important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community. It is also the straightforward statement of a good man who wants no more than what so many of us seek: to be able to be who we are; to do our work; to build families and to contribute to our communities. For so many members of the LGBT community, these simple goals remain elusive."'
p3035
aS"Collins attended Stanford with Clinton's daughter Chelsea and played in a Final Four while at the school. His twin brother, Jarron, was also a longtime NBA center who last played in the league in the 2010-11 season. Collins says he told his brother he was gay last summer."

p3040
aS'"For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find. Without question or hesitation, he gives everything he\'s got to those of us lucky enough to be in his life. I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend," Kennedy said in a statement.'
p3041
aS'In Monday\'s story, Collins writes that the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?"'
p3042
aS"And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city's 2013 gay rights parade."
p3043
aS'"Some people insist they\'ve never met a gay person. But Three Degrees of Jason Collins dictates that no NBA player can claim that anymore. Pro basketball is a family. And pretty much every family I know has a brother, sister or cousin who\'s gay," Collins concludes. "In the brotherhood of the NBA, I just happen to be the one who\'s out."'

p3214
aS'Q: Why is Collins a good fit for this role?'
p3215
aS'Cyd Zeigler, a manager of OutSports.com, a leading website on gay sports, has covered this issue for years.'
p3216
aS'"We\'ve talked about who this person could be in the past. And Jason kind of fits the mold. A really good player who\'s been in the league for a long time who doesn\'t have a lot to lose in endorsement deals. He is set for the rest of his life financially. I never thought it was going to be a superstar."'
p3217
aS'Q: Why is the timing right?'
p3218
aS'Zeigler has written before that the best time for an athlete to make such an announcement would be early in an offseason. Collins\' timing "just two weeks after his regular season ended, and six months before the season starts, it couldn\'t be a better time to do this.

aS'Q: Are pro team sports ready to accept gay athletes in their locker rooms?'
p3222
aS'Madsen said he thinks NBA locker rooms are ready: "Do you respect others, how do you treat others and how do you play? Those are the rules of the locker room. Religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation ... all those things are secondary to the goal of winning basketball games. It\'s a meritocracy in the NBA. People perform or don\'t perform."'
p3223
aS'But Doug Plank, who played for the Chicago Bears in the \'70s and \'80s and coached in the NFL, said on Orlando radio this month: "Everybody tries to be politically correct ... especially people who operate in business and other public occupations. But you get inside an NFL locker room, I tell you what, it\'s something else. It\'s a jungle in there. ... Last time I was in an NFL locker room, changing clothes every day and getting ready to go out to practice, I just think that would be a very, very tough environment for someone to come forward and say they have different sexual orientation."'
p3224
aS'Outside the locker room "we\'ve certainly seen so much more acceptance," Plank said. "It\'s almost normal now. It\'s not a big issue. But there are still those last bastions that are left and sports is one of them. You get into a locker room with these type of individuals that are very, very driven and very physical, and I think it\'s still an issue."'

p3228
aS'Collins started his piece in SI , written with Franz Lidz, by writing: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay."'
p3229
aS'Other excerpts: "I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different.\' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand. ... When I was younger I dated women. I even got engaged. I thought I had to live a certain way. I thought I needed to marry a woman and raise kids with her. I kept telling myself the sky was red, but I always knew it was blue."'
p3230
aS'Later Monday, Collins tweeted: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone"'
p3231
aS'"Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me thru email, texts, calls, tweets, letters, and every other form of communication #support."'
p3232
aS'Q: What about his twin, Jarron, who also played in the NBA?'
p3233
aS'Jarron Collins also wrote a first-person piece for SI in which he said his brother told him last summer: "I won\'t lie. I had no idea. We talked, he answered my questions, I hugged him and I digested what he had told me. At the end of the day, this is what matters: He\'s my brother, he\'s a great guy, and I want him to be happy. I\'ll love him and I\'ll support him and, if necessary, I\'ll protect him."'
p3234
aS"Q: Exactly what was it that ESPN's NBA insider Chris Broussard said on his network's Outside the Lines show?"
p3235
aS'"Personally I don\'t believe that you can live an openly homosexual lifestyle or ... openly (engage in) premarital sex between heterosexuals. If you\'re openly living that type of lifestyle, the Bible says you know them by their fruits, it says that\'s a sin. If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ."'

aS'"This is such a personal thing to reach the point in your life where you\'re prepared to do this. I\'m very proud of him. It\'s a very, very courageous thing that he chose to do. I read the story. It came through that it was very authentic. ... He\'s somebody who didn\'t have the benefit of somebody going before him in the same situation to learn, to watch, to see how people would react. It takes a man of great courage to do what he did today. I\'m happy for him. He\'s going to be able to be the complete Jason Collins every day for the rest of his life.'
p3242
aS'"I think he probably knows what he signed up for. He\'s going to face a whole bunch more television cameras and reporters than he probably has over the course of the last couple seasons. But clearly, it\'s somebody who\'s given this a lot of thought. He\'s prepared for it and it\'s what he signed up for. There\'s been a lot of speculation about when, who, how (an athlete from any of the major sports would come out). And that speculation\'s been put to rest now and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first player to do this."'

p3245
aS'"I don\'t think it will hurt him," Zeigler said. "There are very few front office executives who will look at somebody and say, \'He could help us, but because he\'s gay we don\'t want him.\' There will be some executives who see a marketing opportunity."'
p3246
aS'Veteran NBA executive Ed Stefanski was part of the then-New Jersey Nets front-office staff that drafted Jason Collins No. 18 in the first round in 2001. "His basketball IQ was off the chart," Stefanski said, adding he would be "very disappointed" if Collins\' announcement hurt his chances.'
p3247
aS'"He has done a good job getting his weight down," Stefanski said. "But can he be athletic enough? He\'s smart enough. But can he be a third center for a team? ... A young team can use a player like him in the locker room, and a real good team can use him in spots to give guys a breather and know the team isn\'t going to fall apart when he\'s on the court."'
p3248
aS'Welts is not involved in player personnel decisions, but said: "If he can convince a coach and general manager that he can play and help their team, he\'ll have another job. ... It\'ll all be what he can do on the court."'
p3249
aS"Q: At what point will announcements like Monday's no longer be news?"
p3250
aS'Zeigler: "I don\'t know at what point, whether it\'s No. 7 or 12 or 18, when the media has had enough of this story. We\'re not there yet. Gay people can\'t get married. I can\'t marry my partner of 10 years. When we have equal rights, and we\'re out and proud in every aspect of life, then I think we\'ll see that. But until then, it\'s still an issue."'

p3407
aS'Collins becomes a free agent July 1 and intends to pursue another contract, which might be viewed as a truer test for how N.B.A. teams deal with a gay athlete. However, complicating that question is the fact that Collins, at 34, is a marginal player with limited skills, more valued for his locker-room presence than his play and not at the top of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s list of players to sign. He appeared in just 38 games this season, which he split between the Boston Celtics and the Wizards, and was used sparingly.'

aS'Collins was never among the most skilled centers to begin with, instead relying on his size (7 feet, 255 pounds), intelligence and work ethic to carve out a niche after being drafted 18th over all in 2001.'

aS'One N.B.A. scout estimated that Collins had a 25 percent chance of making an opening-night roster next season, based solely on his basketball skills. But a general manager for another team predicted that Collins would be back in the league because of his reputation as a solid teammate and leader. That general manager said that Collins\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of his sexuality could even appeal to a forward-thinking owner.'

aS'Dave Kopay, who came out as gay in 1975 after a nine-year N.F.L. career, said on Monday he had waited nearly 40 years for this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he did is not easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kopay said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m overwhelmed with how he\xe2\x80\x99s done this.

p3416
aS'Until now, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s only public hint of his orientation was a subtle one. He wore No. 98 for the Celtics and the Wizards, in honor of Matthew Shepard, the gay University of Wyoming student who was killed in 1998. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number has great significance to the gay community,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins wrote.'
p3417
aS'Collins informed his Wizards teammates, as well as Stern, in a series of phone calls Monday morning, before the story was published online. One Wizards teammate, Emeka Okafor, said that if Collins returned to Washington, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome him back with open arms.\xe2\x80\x9d'

As the policed pursued the two suspects on a fiery chase through the Boston area, the rumor spread, leading news vans to stake out the Tripathis\xe2\x80\x99s family home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and reporters to make dozens of calls to the Tripathi family\xe2\x80\x99s cellphones.'
p3919
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was absolutely horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Tripathi, who said her family knew immediately that neither of the men in the photographs was her son \xe2\x80\x94 a man who they said literally would not hurt a fly, choosing instead to set insects free outside.'
p3920
aS'By last Friday morning, investigators had released the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 names \xe2\x80\x94 Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \xe2\x80\x94 absolving Mr. Tripathi of any connection to the case. Apologies began to pour in to the Tripathi family \xe2\x80\x94 including one from the online forum Reddit , where users had doggedly pursued the rumor \xe2\x80\x94 who began a new social media campaign they hoped would persuade Sunil to come home.'
p3921
aS'The authorities used dental records to identify the body as Mr. Tripathi\xe2\x80\x99s. They did not immediately determine the cause of his death, but said his body had been in the water for some time.'
p3922
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cBe open to letting someone in when it is you who is faltering,\xe2\x80\x9d read the Tripathi family\xe2\x80\x99s statement. \xe2\x80\x9cLend your hand. We need it. The world needs it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
