S'By Robbie Ward TUPELO, Mississippi (Reuters) - A Mississippi martial arts instructor was charged on Saturday with attempting to use a biological weapon after a ricin-laced letter was sent to President Barack Obama earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice said. Everett Dutschke , 41, was arrested at his Tupelo home shortly after midnight by FBI agents following searches of the residence and a former business as part of the ricin letter investigation. He was later charged with "developing ... and possessing" ricin and "attempting" to use it "as a weapon," according to a joint statement by the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Mississippi and the head of the FBI\'s Mississippi office. Ricin is a highly lethal poison made from castor beans. If convicted, Dutschke faces maximum possible penalties of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. His arrest came several days after U.S. prosecutors dropped charges in the case on Tuesday against another Mississippi man, Kevin Curtis , who was released from jail after a search of his home revealed no incriminating evidence. Dutschke\'s name first surfaced when Curtis\' attorney suggested in a court hearing that her client had been framed by someone, and mentioned a running feud between Dutschke and Curtis. Saturday\'s announcement did not specify if Dutschke was being charged in relation to the ricin letters, but it noted that the investigation had been conducted by several federal agencies including the U. S. Postal Inspection Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, did not return calls seeking comment, but she told Reuters earlier in the week that her client denied having anything to do with the ricin letters. Dutschke is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday. Federal agents initially targeted Curtis, an Elvis impersonator, in their efforts to find who sent the letters laced with ricin. Letters addressed to Obama and Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, were retrieved last week at off-site mail facilities before reaching their intended victims. A Mississippi state judge also received a ricin-laced letter. Discovery of the letters fueled more national anxiety in the days after the bombing at the Boston Marathon. The case also brought extra scrutiny for the FBI almost 12 years after a 2001 letter-borne anthrax attack that killed five people and puzzled investigators for years. The anthrax investigation came in the wake of the September 11, 2001, hijacked plane attacks on the United States. Federal agents in unmarked vehicles were stationed in streets surrounding Dutschke\'s home on Friday afternoon and all evening. Agents from the FBI and members of an anti-terrorist response team from the Mississippi National Guard, some wearing hazardous material suits, had searched the home on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as the premises of a former martial arts studio Dutschke ran in the city. Dutschke was cooperating with federal officials during the searches this week, his attorney said. \'MISSING PIECES\' Suspicion had originally fallen on Curtis because of wording contained in all three ricin letters, which included his initials "KC." Dutschke has told local media that he knew Curtis but had only had contact with him three times, and not since 2010. Curtis, 45, told the Northeastern Mississippi Daily Journal that he believed Dutschke deliberately sabotaged his career as a performer by calling sponsors and telling them about Curtis\' numerous prior arrests. "I lost 12 really big shows in 2011 and eight in 2012 directly linked to him," Curtis told the newspaper. Dutschke, who fronted a two-man blues band in Tupelo called RoboDrum, ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate in 2007 against Stephen Holland, a Democratic state representative from the Tupelo area. Holland\'s mother, Sadie, is the judge to whom one of the ricin-tainted letters was mailed this month. Curtis\'s brother and fellow Elvis impersonator, insurance agent Jack Curtis , worked for a time with Dutschke and said he believed the feud with Dutschke was related to his brother\'s efforts to publicize allegations about a black market for body parts at a local Mississippi hospital. Kevin Curtis was fired as a janitor from North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo after raising questions about body parts he said he observed there. The hospital strongly denied the allegations. Dutschke faces other charges related to an April 1 indictment for fondling three children between ages 7 and 16, from 2007 to 2013, according to court records. RICIN POTENCY The FBI said on Thursday that more tests may be necessary to determine the potency of a granular material identified as ricin contained in the letters. An FBI agent testified in court in Mississippi that the ricin found in the letters was in a crude form and looked like castor beans ground up in a blender, according to media accounts. Experts have said ricin in that form would have a low potency. Castor bean plants are grown as ornamental shrubs in the Southern United States, but there is no domestic castor oil production and it is mostly imported from India and China. Milton Leitenberg, senior research scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at the University of Maryland, said the vast majority of ricin cases since the 1960s had involved crude ricin preparations made from recipes published in manuals and on the Internet. "You could ingest this crude stuff, swallow a couple of tablespoons and you\'d probably vomit, but not much more," Leitenberg said in a telephone interview. A material like that described in the ricin court hearing would pose little danger, Leitenberg said. (Additional reporting by Emily Lane in Jackson, Mississippi, Marilyn W.

S'A former taekwondo instructor was taken into custody early Saturday by federal authorities in Mississippi, accused of mailing letters containing the poison ricin to the president, a United States senator and a local judge. The arrest of J. Everett Dutschke, 41, of Tupelo is the second in two weeks in connection with the case. An earlier suspect, an Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis, of Corinth, Miss., was released after no evidence was found linking him to the letters. Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer had said during a hearing in federal court that Mr. Dutschke appeared to have framed Mr. Curtis. Deborah Madden, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Jackson, said Mr. Dutschke was arrested at home shortly before 1 a.m. A law enforcement official in Tupelo said his arrest was uneventful. \xe2\x80\x9cHe walked out, and they took him into custody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sgt. James Hood of the Tupelo Police Department. \xe2\x80\x9cNo problem or anything.\xe2\x80\x9d A lawyer for Mr. Dutschke did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Saturday. Mr. Dutschke has been charged with \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping, producing, stockpiling, transferring, acquiring, retaining and possessing a biological agent\xe2\x80\x9d for use as a weapon. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Oxford on Monday. The arrest is the latest chapter in a bizarre case that began during the tense week of the Boston Marathon bombing. The authorities announced that letters addressed to President Obama and Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, had been found to contain a \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious granular substance,\xe2\x80\x9d which was later determined to be ricin, a deadly poison. A similar letter with the substance was also sent to Judge Sadie Holland of Lee County Justice Court. The letters spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cMissing Pieces\xe2\x80\x9d and were signed \xe2\x80\x9cI am KC and I approve this message,\xe2\x80\x9d both standard parts of e-mail messages sent to public officials by Mr. Curtis, who had been on a one-man campaign for more than a decade to expose what he said was an illicit organ-harvesting scheme at a Tupelo hospital. Mr. Curtis was arrested on April 17. While he was in custody, federal agents searched his home as well as the home of a former wife, but found no evidence tying him to the letters. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that the letters had been carefully written to mimic Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic phrasing and concerns. Though they regretted having arrested a man they now consider innocent, they had wanted to move quickly to prevent more poisoned letters from being sent, one official said. Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s brother Jack said that neither he nor other relatives immediately dismissed the charges as false, given Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s history of mental illness. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could understand, especially with the things that were tied to his initials,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could see why somebody would think it was Kevin. But when they said President Obama, I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Somebody messed up because he likes Obama.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d The family said that Mr. Curtis might have been framed, and Jack Curtis said he told the authorities to look at Mr. Dutschke, who used to work for him and had long had an antagonistic relationship with Mr. Curtis. In a hearing in federal court last Monday, Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer mentioned Mr. Dutschke by name. Mr. Dutschke and Mr. Curtis had feuded, mostly online, on a variety of topics, including their music careers, Mr. Curtis\xe2\x80\x99s admittedly false claim of being a member of Mensa , and Mr. Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to publish the organ-harvesting accusations in a local newsletter. Mr. Dutschke, a bright but often abrasive man who ran unsuccessfully for the state legislature, was arrested this year on charges of molesting three under-age girls, one as young as 7. He pleaded not guilty this month. On Tuesday, Mr. Curtis was released, the charges against him dropped. At a news conference, Mr. Curtis said he did not blame the authorities but added that \xe2\x80\x9cthis past week has been a nightmare for me and my family.\xe2\x80\x9d On Tuesday and Wednesday, federal agents searched Mr. Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s home and his former school, Tupelo Taekwondo Plus. James D. Moore, the prosecuting attorney for Lee County, said evidence had been found but he would not characterize its nature. As he became the focus of the inquiry, Mr. Dutschke denied having anything to do with the ricin letters but tried to keep a low profile, to the point where the authorities briefly lost track of him. The strangeness of the whole series of events was not shocking to some who know both men. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been bad blood between those two for years,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Moore said. Of their entanglement in this case, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cHindsight\xe2\x80\x99s 20/20, but knowing these two guys, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d'

S'The federal charges against James Everett Dutschke come days after prosecutors dropped charges against Paul Kevin Curtis in the same case amid Curtis\' claims he was framed. Dutschke, 41, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Oxford on Monday before Magistrate Judge S. Allan Alexander, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Mississippi. Dutschke was arrested without incident at his home early Saturday, FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said. Earlier this week, agents searched Dutschke\'s residence and former martial arts studio, though it\'s not clear what they found. \'A train has been lifted off my shoulder,\' former suspect says The arrest of Dutschke is the latest twist in a bizarre case that began earlier this month when federal investigators arrested Curtis, an Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, for allegedly sending letters containing ricin, a deadly toxin, to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County. The letters touched off anxieties in Washington and elsewhere in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. Authorities later said the Boston bombings and the ricin-tainted letters were unrelated. The revelation of the ricin-laden letters recalled the fear that gripped the country in the days following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks when anthrax-laced letters were sent to U.S. senators and journalists. Curtis cleared The FBI said the recent letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses have been reported. Prosecutors on Tuesday dropped the charges against Curtis after his attorney, Christi McCoy, told authorities that she believed her client was framed, possibly by Dutschke. As Curtis, 45, walked out of jail, FBI agents were searching Dutschke\'s home and the studio where he practiced martial arts. At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he agreed to the FBI search "to help clear my name." "I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters," he said. \'I am KC\' The letters read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance." They were signed "I am KC and I approve this message," a source told CNN. Each letter had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. Curtis, a self-styled activist known as Kevin Curtis, has used similar signoffs on letters and social media posts, his attorney said. "I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him," attorney McCoy told CNN. Curtis told CNN that he didn\'t even know what ricin was until he got out of jail and looked it up on the Internet. When police stormed his home and arrested him last week, Curtis said an investigator asked him about ricin, and Curtis said he responded, "Well, I don\'t eat rice, and I don\'t have any rice in the house." Online feud Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, has said her client used to work for Curtis\' brother, but the two have had no contact since 2010. Basham declined to comment on Dutschke\'s arrest Saturday. The relationship between the two men is at best hazy, with each publicly accusing the other of bad behavior. Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book, but later had a falling out. He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the former taekwondo instructor has denied. Dutschke told reporters this week that he did not know Curtis well. "He\'s just a little nutty. I don\'t have a relationship with him," he said. "I\'ve met him two times in person, and then there was a third time we sent e-mails back and forth." In the e-mail exchange, according to Dutschke, he accused Curtis of posting a fake membership certificate for MENSA, the high-IQ organization. Curtis acknowledged that he posted a fake certificate, but said he did it to catch Dutschke stalking him online. Ties to letters? Authorities have not said how they linked the letters to Dutschke, who appears to have personal ties to at least two of the three people who were sent letters. In 2007, Dutschke failed in his bid as a Republican to defeat Democratic state representative Steve Holland, whose mother, a judge, received one of the ricin-tainted letters. "We just want to move on," Holland told CNN, adding that he wanted justice for his mother. "This could have been devastating. Mom could have died had this taken the worst-case scenario." Dutschke also has said he has met Wicker. Other charges Dutschke, meanwhile, faces molestation charges in an unrelated case. According to a grand jury indictment handed down this month and obtained by CNN, he is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. The accusations go back as far as 2007, according to the indictment. Dutschke has repeatedly denied the charges in interviews with local media, and he pleaded innocent in court this month. He closed his taekwondo studio after the allegations were made public.'

S'Everett Dutschke, 41, was taken into custody in Tupelo, Miss., and later charged with being in possession of a biological weapon. TUPELO, Miss. \xe2\x80\x94 A Mississippi martial arts instructor arrested early on Saturday was charged with possession of the biological agent ricin and with attempting to use it as a weapon, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. James Everett Dutschke, age 41, was arrested following searches of his home and a former business as part of an investigation into ricin-laced letters sent to President Barack Obama and two other public officials. Dutschke was taken into custody by FBI agents at his Tupelo home in the early hours of Saturday morning, FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said in a statement. If convicted, Dutschke faces maximum possible penalties of life imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and 5 years of supervised release. Dutschke is expected to appear in the United States District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday. U.S. prosecutors dropped charges on Tuesday against another Mississippi man, Elvis impersonator Kevin Curtis, who was released from jail after a search of his home in nearby Corinth revealed no incriminating evidence. Prosecutors said at the time that the investigation had "revealed new information" but provided no details. Dutschke\'s attorney, Lori Basham, did not return calls seeking comment but told Reuters earlier in the week that her client denied having anything to do with the ricin letters. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as members of an anti-terrorist response team from the Mississippi National Guard, some wearing hazardous-material suits, had searched Dutschke\'s home Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as the premises of a former martial arts studio Dutschke ran in the city. Dutschke was cooperating with federal officials during the searches this week, the attorney said. The agents had Dutschke\'s home under surveillance Friday afternoon and evening, and moved to arrest him about 1 a.m. local time. On Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges against another Mississippi man, Elvis impersonator Kevin Curtis, who was released from jail after a search of his home in nearby Corinth revealed no incriminating evidence. Prosecutors said at the time that the investigation had "revealed new information" but provided no details. The case has brought extra scrutiny on the FBI almost 12 years after a 2001 letter-borne anthrax attack\xc2\xa0after\xc2\xa0the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington. It took investigators seven years to solve the anthrax case. Letters addressed to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and President Barack Obama were retrieved last week at off-site mail facilities before reaching their intended victims. A state judge also received a ricin-laced letter. The discovery added another layer of anxiety as authorities dealt with bombings at the Boston Marathon. Ricin, which is made from castor beans, can be deadly to humans and is considered a potential terrorist weapon, particularly if refined into an aerosol form. Dutschke\'s name first surfaced in a federal court hearing Monday for Curtis in which his attorney suggested her client had been framed by someone. She mentioned a running feud between Dutschke and Curtis, albeit over a number of seemingly petty issues. Suspicion originally had\xc2\xa0fallen on Curtis because of wording contained in all three ricin letters that appeared to incriminate him. "Maybe I have your attention now / Even if that means someone must die," the letters read in part, according to the affidavit. The letters ended: "I am KC and I approve this message." The initials "KC" led law enforcement officials to ask Wicker\'s staff if they were aware of any constituents with those initials, and the focus of the investigation then turned to Curtis, according to an affidavit from the FBI and the Secret Service filed in court.

S'The FBI believes it has the right man this time in the tangled case of the ricin-laced letters mailed to President Obama and two other public officials. In the early-morning darkness Saturday, four days after authorities dropped charges against an Elvis impersonator in Mississippi, FBI agents arrested a man the impersonator had been feuding with \xe2\x80\x94 a former radio announcer and onetime candidate for the state legislature who recently was charged with child molestation. James Everett Dutschke, 41, was taken into custody about 12:50 a.m. Saturday at his home in Tupelo, Miss., the FBI said. He could face life in prison on federal charges of \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly developing, producing, stockpiling, transferring, acquiring, retaining and possessing a biological agent, toxin and delivery system, for use as a weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Oxford, Miss. Dutschke proclaimed his innocence last week, saying he had cooperated with investigators and insisting he had no idea how to manufacture ricin, a toxin derived from the castor bean plant that can kill quickly if inhaled. Lori Nail Basham, Dutschke\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, declined to comment Saturday on her client\xe2\x80\x99s arrest. Dutschke had been the target of the investigation since the release from jail last week of Paul Kevin Curtis , 45, of Corinth, Miss. Curtis is the Elvis impersonator whom federal investigators initially charged with sending the poison letters to Obama, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Lee County Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland. Holland said in a phone interview Saturday that she can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why Dutschke would have wanted to send her a poisoned letter, as authorities allege \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI have no earthly idea\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but that she does remember having one unpleasant encounter with him. In 2007, Dutschke ran as a Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives against her son, state Rep. Steve Holland, a Democrat. The judge said she attended a rally at which Dutschke excoriated her son\xe2\x80\x99s performance in office. She confronted him afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him: \xe2\x80\x98This is no way to run a campaign. You need to tell the people what you will do and what you have done. Don\xe2\x80\x99t run your opponent down,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Days later, she said, Dutschke came to her office and apologized to her. His candidacy was not successful. Earlier this month, Holland went to work and learned that she had received a letter in an envelope with something granular rattling inside. She opened the letter, which contained a vague death threat and was signed, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is KC and I approve this message.\xe2\x80\x9d She didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the mysterious material fall out of the letter, and she washed her hands carefully, she said. She felt no ill effects, but the grainy material was ricin, authorities later determined. The federal investigation initially focused on Curtis , who also had a connection to Holland. She sentenced him to six months in jail for a 2003 assault on a Tupelo lawyer, according to court documents. Curtis had also been hired by Wicker to perform at a party in his Elvis persona.'

S'LOS ANGELES (AP) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 Jurors in the civil case between Michael Jackson\'s mother and concert giant AEG Live got another glimpse of the singer\'s private life on Tuesday through the eyes of a paramedic who described the singer\'s bedroom and the frantic efforts to revive the King of Pop on the day he died. Many other private moments from the singer\'s life will be exposed as the case progresses over the next several months, with witnesses expected to testify about secret medical treatments, lavish spending and tender moments spent with his mother and children. In the nearly four years since his death, nearly every aspect of Jackson\'s life has been explored in court proceedings, documentaries, books and news stories. Still, the negligence case filed by his mother against AEG promises to deliver the most detailed account of the singer\'s addiction struggles, including testimony from his ex-wife Debbie Rowe about treatments involving the anesthetic propofol dating back to the 1990s. Jackson died from a propofol overdose in 2009 while preparing for a series of comeback concerts at AEG\'s O2 Arena in London. Katherine Jackson contends AEG didn\'t properly investigate the doctor who later administered the fatal dose. The company denies wrongdoing. During opening statements, attorneys framed Jackson\'s prescription drug addiction through the prism of his superstar status. Attorney Brian Panish, who represents Katherine Jackson, said the drug problems worsened when the pop star was under the stress of live performances. AEG attorney Marvin S. Putnam countered that Jackson\'s stardom provided a cover to receive multiple, secret medical treatments, many involving propofol. At one point in the proceedings, the harsh portrayal of Jackson\'s struggle with addiction led one juror to lean forward and stare at the floor for several moments. Katherine Jackson and two of the superstar\'s children, Prince and Paris, are potential witnesses whose testimony would likely focus heavily on their grieving and losses. Panish played a song Jackson wrote for his children as a montage of photos played during opening statements. He also read a handwritten note from Jackson that his mother framed and has hanging on her wall. "The only way you can assess damages, is to know what they had," Panish told jurors Monday before reading the letter and playing "You Are My Life." Katherine Jackson dabbed her eyes with a tissue. On Tuesday, she left the courtroom while the paramedic described her son\'s condition on the day he died. It may be several days before jurors get another look at Jackson\'s softer side. The trial will also feature testimony about Jackson\'s troubled finances, with debts that reached nearly $400 million by the time he died. AEG contends the debts made him desperate to have a successful concert series. "The private Michael Jackson was like a lot of Americans in the 2000s, spending a lot more than he was making," Putnam told the jury after describing the singer\'s lavish Neverland Ranch, his art collection and other spending. A Los Angeles police detective who investigated Jackson\'s doctor, Conrad Murray, told jurors Tuesday the physician was more than $500,000 in debt and may have been motivated by a large payday for working with Jackson. Detective Orlando Martinez testified that he looked into Murray\'s finances searching for a financial motive for his role in Jackson\'s death and relied mostly on public records. He turned up that Murray\'s Las Vegas home was in foreclosure proceedings, and Murray faced several liens for unpaid child support and other unpaid debts. The searches led Martinez to conclude that Murray\'s financial condition was "severely distressed." Martinez said that led him to believe Murray\'s actions were motivated by the $150,000 a month he expected to be paid by AEG. "He may break the rules, bend the rules, do whatever he needed to do to get paid," Martinez said. "It might solve his money problems." Murray\'s finances were not a factor in the criminal case that ended with his 2011 conviction for administering a fatal dose of propofol to Jackson. Martinez also showed jurors photographs the various medications officers uncovered in Jackson\'s bedroom, including several vials of propofol. With the start of testimony Tuesday, the panel was transported by paramedic Richard Senneff into the singer\'s bedroom, a place he kept locked and where his propofol treatments were administered out of sight of everyone but Murray. Senneff, a paramedic and firefighter for nearly 28 years, told the panel about responding to Jackson\'s bedroom on June 25, 2009, and finding an unusual scene. He described Murray\'s frazzled efforts to revive Jackson. "He was pale, he was sweaty," the paramedic said of Murray. "He was very busy." He said Jackson appeared to be terminally ill. "To me, he looked like someone who was at the end stage of a long disease process," Senneff said, adding that Murray told him that he was treating Jackson for dehydration. Senneff told the panel he found an IV pole, oxygen tanks and a nightstand with several medicine bottles. Just as he previously testified in Murray\'s criminal trial, the paramedic told the panel that Murray never mentioned propofol. Jackson\'s blue hands, feet and lips, and the singer\'s dry eyes all signaled to Senneff that the singer was dead and hadn\'t been breathing for a long time. Onlookers and paparazzi were already gathering at Jackson\'s gate and someone pressed a camera to the ambulance window to get pictures of the stricken star. ___ Anthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP .'

S'Michael Jackson\'s family and friends knew the King of Pop abused prescription drugs, an attorney for Jackson\'s mother told a Los Angeles jury today, yet the promoters of his ill-fated 2009 comeback tour denied any knowledge of it. In his opening statements today, attorney Brian Panish, who is representing Katherine Jackson in her wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, told jurors that officials with the concert promoter were so focused on beating the competition with Jackson\'s "This Is It" tour that they relentlessly pushed the King of Pop to perform despite numerous warning signs about his health, and negligently hired Dr. Conrad Murray, the man convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol. "They wanted to be No. 1 at all costs," Panish said. "We\'re not looking for any sympathy... We\'re looking for truth and justice." Panish detailed Jackson\'s prescription drug abuse history, saying the singer regularly used demerol and propofol, and that "people who knew him believed he had a problem with prescription medication." "[Michael Jackson\'s] stirring voice, his musical genius, his creativity and his generosity and his huge heart was extinguished forever," Panish said. "You\'re going to hear the whole story about what happened in the death of Michael Jackson." AEG officials have denied all wrongdoing in the civil suit filed by Katherine Jackson and the singer\'s three children, saying that Murray, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011, was an independent contractor hired by Jackson. Marvin S. Putnam, the lawyer representing AEG Live, told jurors in his opening remarks today that the concert promoter officials could not have known about Jackson\'s private life, including his propofol use, and could not have foreseen circumstances that led to a physician giving the pop star doses of the anesthetic as a sleep aid. "The truth is, Michael Jackson fooled everyone," Putnam said. "He made sure that no one, nobody, knew his deepest darkest secrets." Murray is currently serving four years in prison for his role in the pop superstar\'s death and is appealing his conviction. Katherine Jackson and two of her children, Rebbie and Randy Jackson, sat in the front row of the courtroom, as Jackson fans and media thronged the hallways and the areas outside the courthouse. No cameras were allowed inside the courtroom. Tens of millions of dollars, not to mention the worldwide pop music icon\'s reputation, are at stake in this trial. A jury comprised of six men and six women will hear arguments that are expected to last into the summer to decide if AEG is liable for damages. The case is expected to delve into the highly guarded personal life of Jackson, who died at age 50 four years ago, and provide the most in-depth details of the superstar\'s final days. The trial is expected to include detailed testimony about other doctors\' treatment of Jackson, a subject that was largely off-limits in the criminal case. "I think this case is important because in the Conrad Murray case, I think everyone believes we got part of the story of Michael Jackson. This trial is important because we will get the rest of the story," HLN anchor Vinnie Politan told ABC News. A who\'s who of Hollywood was lining up to support the Jackson family. The expected star-studded witness list included Quincy Jones, Diana Ross, Lou Ferrigno and Spike Lee. Both of Jackson\'s ex-wives, Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, were listed as potential witnesses.'

S'The concert promoter has no choice to reveal Jackson\'s "deepest, darkest secret" because the company must defend itself from the accusation from Jackson\'s family that it is responsible for the pop icon\'s death, Marvin Putnam said. Before Putnam began, a Jackson lawyer played for the jury a sentimental song Jackson wrote and recorded for his three children titled "You Are My Life." "You are the sun, you make me shine more like the stars that twinkle at night, You are the moon that glows in my heart, You\'re my day time, my nighttime, My world. You are my life." Katherine Jackson, his mother, wiped tears from her face as her late son\'s soft voice filled the small courtroom. And so begins a trial, which could last several months, that promises dramatic revelations and legal fireworks. With opening statements delivered, the Jackson\'s call their first witness Tuesday morning -- Orlando Martinez, the Los Angeles Police detective who investigated Jackson\'s death. AEG Live executives are "ruthless guys" who ignored Michael Jackson\'s health problems and his doctor\'s ethical conflicts, which led to the pop icon\'s death, a Jackson family lawyer argued Monday. Jurors earning $15 a day will decide whether one of the world\'s largest entertainment companies should pay Jackson\'s mother and three children billions of dollars for its liability in the pop icon\'s death. Randy and Rebbie Jackson, Michael\'s siblings, were with their mother in the front row, just a few feet away from jurors. "There will be no question in your mind that they were ruthless and they wanted to be No. 1 at all cost," Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said. AEG executives knew that Jackson was emotionally and physically weak, Panish told jurors. Jackson was in an "obvious sharp decline" in the weeks after Murray began working as his personal doctor while he prepared for his comeback concerts. Another warning sign should have been that Murray asked for $5 million for the job and eventually agreed on $150,000 a month, Panish said. Another doctor had told AEG he would do the job for $40,000 a month as long as Jackson was "clean," meaning not on drugs, he said. Panish played for the jury a video of an AEG expert who agreed that Murray\'s pay demand was "outrageous." "That raised red flag because it was an enormous sum of money," defense expert Marty Hom said. "AEG ignored the obvious red flags, and they hired Dr. Murray," Panish said. Later in the trial, jurors will hear Michael\'s oldest son and daughter describe their father\'s last days. But they will also endure weeks of testimony from medical and financial experts offering opinions about the singer\'s health, addiction and career. Only 16 journalists and a few members of the public will be allowed inside the courtroom because many of its 45 seats are reserved for parties involved in the trial, including the Jackson family. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos denied CNN\'s request to televise the trial. Jurors chosen to decide Michael Jackson wrongful death case The central i ssue The central issue is simple: Did AEG Live, the company promoting Jackson\'s comeback concerts in 2009, hire or supervise Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson\'s June 25, 2009, death? Jackson died two weeks before his "This Is It" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London. The coroner ruled Jackson died from a fatal combination of sedatives and propofol, a surgical anesthetic that Murray told investigators he used to put Jackson to sleep almost every night in the month before his death. The Jacksons argue that AEG executives knew about the star\'s weakened health and his past use of dangerous drugs while on tour. They\'re liable in his death because they pressured Jackson and the doctor to meet their ambitious schedule to prepare for the London shows despite that knowledge, their lawyers contend. A cornerstone of their case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson\'s death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him." Jackson lawyers argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray\'s fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson\'s personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Gongaware, in a video deposition played in court Monday, said he could not remember writing the e-mail, which the Jackson lawyers call the "smoking gun" in their case. "They put Dr. Murray in a position where if he said Michael can\'t go or can\'t play, if he said I can\'t give you those drugs, then he doesn\'t get paid," Panish told jurors Monday. Gongaware, who managed two of Jackson\'s tours in the 1990s, knew that Jackson relied on addictive opiates during his concert tours, Panish said. He played a video of one doctor who said he warned Gongaware about it in 1993. "We felt that we needed to an intervention," Dr. Stuart Finkelstein said. "We needed to do detox." AEG\'s lawyer argued Monday that Gongaware and other AEG executives had no way of knowing about Jackson\'s use of propofol to sleep. "AEG knew nothing about this decade-long propofol use," Putnam said. "They were a concert promoter. How could they know?" He promised that Jackson\'s ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, will testify that she assisted in administering propofol to Jackson in the 1990s when she was a nurse. She saw several doctors put Mr. Jackson to sleep in hotel rooms while on tour," he said, including in Munich, London, Paris. "The truth is Mr. Jackson fooled everyone," Putnam said about Jackson\'s porpofol use. "He kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest, darkest secret." Jackson\'s ability to keep his private side private meant AEG could not see any red flags warning of Jackson\'s destruction, Putnam said. "They didn\'t see this coming," he said. "They had no idea." Putnam said Jackson family members will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening. "If they didn\'t know what was going on, how could someone else think there was even a problem," he said. AEG contends that Jackson was responsible for his own demise, that he chose Murray to be his full-time doctor and that his drug addiction led him to a series of fatal choices. "This case is about personal choices," Putnam said. "People have responsibility for their personal choices. It was not a tragedy of AEG Live\'s making." Murray was never an AEG employee but rather was chosen and paid by Jackson for nearly four years until Jackson died, AEG lawyers contend. "AEG Live never paid Dr. Murray anything, ever," Putnam said. He played a snippet from Murray\'s interview with Martinez two days after Jackson\'s death. "I am an employee for Michael Jackson but paid through AEG," Murray told police. Jackson, not AEG chose Murray, he said. Child molestation accusations against Jackson, for which he was acquitted after a trial, are relevant because they resulted in an increase in his drug use, Putnam said. He focused on Jackson\'s doctor shopping for drugs, displaying a chart of 40 doctors and nurses who Jackson sought drugs from. Elvis\' ghost haunts Michael Jackson death trial Jackson\'s family seeks billions Just before Monday\'s session began, the judge issued a series of rulings that will allow Jackson expert witnesses to testify but limit some of their opinions. The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. Jackson lawyers denied media reports that they were seeking $40 billion in damages if AEG Live is found liable, but it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson\'s income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price. Palazuelos reversed an earlier tentative decision Monday that would have limited the amount of damages the Jacksons could argue AEG should pay if found liable in the singer\'s death. \xc2\xa0The decision raises the potential damages by about $1 billion. One of the Jacksons\' experts, certified public accountant Arthur Erk, estimated that Michael Jackson could have earned $1.4 billion by taking his "This Is It" tour around the world for 260 shows. AEG executives discussed extending the tour beyond the 50 shows scheduled for London, Jackson lawyers said. Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders, in arguing for the judge to allow Erk\'s testimony, said when "This Is It" tickets went on sale in March 2009, there was the "highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world. No one has ever come close." "There was so much demand, they filled 2 million seats in hours," Sanders said, quoting an e-mail from AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips sent to AEG\'s owner. "We would have had to do 100-plus shows to fill the demand" in London, he said Phillips wrote. Jackson could have packed the Tokyo Dome several times in a world tour, he said. But AEG lawyer Sabrina Strong called it "very speculative" that Jackson would have even finished the 50 London shows before dying. AEG lawyers argued that Jackson didn\'t perform 260 shows and make that much money even in his prime. "He never came anywhere close to that," Strong said. "No one other than Cher has ever done that." Erk also calculated Jackson would have followed with four more world tours before he turned 65. Palazuelos weighed in during a hearing on Thursday, noting that the Rolling Stones are still touring into their 70s. The Jacksons will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of Las Vegas shows, endorsements, a clothing line and movies. Strong argued that Jackson had a history of failed projects and missed opportunities, calling Erk\'s projections "a hope, a dream, and not a basis for damages." Erk, under the new ruling, will be able to tell jurors about the\xc2\xa0"loss of earning capacity" suffered by the family because of Jackson\'s death. \xc2\xa0This means the jury can consider the Jackson argument that he\xc2\xa0could have earned millions with a clothing line, endorsements and movies. The expert\'s estimate that Jackson would have completed five world tours before he was 65, if he had lived, can also be considered. AEG can argue, however, that Jackson\'s past failures diminished the potential earnings. None of the Jackson experts can offer an opinion on the question of whether Murray was hired by AEG. The witness lists include many members of the Jackson family, including Katherine Jackson. Other celebrity witnesses on the list are Sharon Osbourne , Quincy Jones, Spike Lee, Ray Parker Jr., Lisa Marie Presley, Diana Ross and Lou Ferrigno.

aS'"There will be no question in your mind that they were ruthless and they wanted to be No. 1 at all cost," Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said.'
p785
aS'AEG executives knew that Jackson was emotionally and physically weak, Panish told jurors.'
p786
aS'Jackson was in an "obvious sharp decline" in the weeks after Murray began working as his personal doctor while he prepared for his comeback concerts.'
p787
aS'Another warning sign should have been that Murray asked for $5 million for the job and eventually agreed on $150,000 a month, Panish said. Another doctor had told AEG he would do the job for $40,000 a month as long as Jackson was "clean," meaning not on drugs, he said.'
p788
aS'Panish played for the jury a video of an AEG expert who agreed that Murray\'s pay demand was "outrageous."'

p793
aS'Jurors chosen to decide Michael Jackson wrongful death case'
p794
aS'The central i ssue'
p795
aS"The central issue is simple: Did AEG Live, the company promoting Jackson's comeback concerts in 2009, hire or supervise Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's June 25, 2009, death?"
p796
aS'Jackson died two weeks before his "This Is It" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London. The coroner ruled Jackson died from a fatal combination of sedatives and propofol, a surgical anesthetic that Murray told investigators he used to put Jackson to sleep almost every night in the month before his death.'
p797
aS"The Jacksons argue that AEG executives knew about the star's weakened health and his past use of dangerous drugs while on tour. They're liable in his death because they pressured Jackson and the doctor to meet their ambitious schedule to prepare for the London shows despite that knowledge, their lawyers contend."
p798
aS'A cornerstone of their case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson\'s death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."'
p799
aS"Jackson lawyers argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray's fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health."
p800
aS'Gongaware, in a video deposition played in court Monday, said he could not remember writing the e-mail, which the Jackson lawyers call the "smoking gun" in their case.'
p801
aS'"They put Dr. Murray in a position where if he said Michael can\'t go or can\'t play, if he said I can\'t give you those drugs, then he doesn\'t get paid," Panish told jurors Monday.'
p802
aS"Gongaware, who managed two of Jackson's tours in the 1990s, knew that Jackson relied on addictive opiates during his concert tours, Panish said."
p803
aS'He played a video of one doctor who said he warned Gongaware about it in 1993.'
p804
aS'"We felt that we needed to an intervention," Dr. Stuart Finkelstein said. "We needed to do detox."'
p805
aS"AEG's lawyer argued Monday that Gongaware and other AEG executives had no way of knowing about Jackson's use of propofol to sleep."
p806
aS'"AEG knew nothing about this decade-long propofol use," Putnam said. "They were a concert promoter. How could they know?"'
p807
aS"He promised that Jackson's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, will testify that she assisted in administering propofol to Jackson in the 1990s when she was a nurse."
p808
aS'She saw several doctors put Mr. Jackson to sleep in hotel rooms while on tour," he said, including in Munich, London, Paris.'
p809
aS'"The truth is Mr. Jackson fooled everyone," Putnam said about Jackson\'s porpofol use. "He kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest, darkest secret."'
p810
aS"Jackson's ability to keep his private side private meant AEG could not see any red flags warning of Jackson's destruction, Putnam said."
p811
aS'"They didn\'t see this coming," he said. "They had no idea."'
p812
aS'Putnam said Jackson family members will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening.'
p813
aS'"If they didn\'t know what was going on, how could someone else think there was even a problem," he said.'
p814
aS'AEG contends that Jackson was responsible for his own demise, that he chose Murray to be his full-time doctor and that his drug addiction led him to a series of fatal choices.'
p815
aS'"This case is about personal choices," Putnam said. "People have responsibility for their personal choices. It was not a tragedy of AEG Live\'s making."'
p816
aS'Murray was never an AEG employee but rather was chosen and paid by Jackson for nearly four years until Jackson died, AEG lawyers contend.'
p817
aS'"AEG Live never paid Dr. Murray anything, ever," Putnam said.'
p818
aS"He played a snippet from Murray's interview with Martinez two days after Jackson's death."
p819
aS'"I am an employee for Michael Jackson but paid through AEG," Murray told police.'
p820
aS'Jackson, not AEG chose Murray, he said.'
p821
aS'Child molestation accusations against Jackson, for which he was acquitted after a trial, are relevant because they resulted in an increase in his drug use, Putnam said.'
p822
aS"He focused on Jackson's doctor shopping for drugs, displaying a chart of 40 doctors and nurses who Jackson sought drugs from."
p823
aS"Elvis' ghost haunts Michael Jackson death trial"
p824
aS"Jackson's family seeks billions"
p825
aS"Just before Monday's session began, the judge issued a series of rulings that will allow Jackson expert witnesses to testify but limit some of their opinions."
p826
aS"The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. Jackson lawyers denied media reports that they were seeking $40 billion in damages if AEG Live is found liable, but it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential."
p827
aS'AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price.'
p828
aS"Palazuelos reversed an earlier tentative decision Monday that would have limited the amount of damages the Jacksons could argue AEG should pay if found liable in the singer's death. \xc2\xa0The decision raises the potential damages by about $1 billion."
p829
aS'One of the Jacksons\' experts, certified public accountant Arthur Erk, estimated that Michael Jackson could have earned $1.4 billion by taking his "This Is It" tour around the world for 260 shows. AEG executives discussed extending the tour beyond the 50 shows scheduled for London, Jackson lawyers said.'
p830
aS'Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders, in arguing for the judge to allow Erk\'s testimony, said when "This Is It" tickets went on sale in March 2009, there was the "highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world. No one has ever come close."'
p831
aS'"There was so much demand, they filled 2 million seats in hours," Sanders said, quoting an e-mail from AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips sent to AEG\'s owner.'
p832
aS'"We would have had to do 100-plus shows to fill the demand" in London, he said Phillips wrote. Jackson could have packed the Tokyo Dome several times in a world tour, he said.'
p833
aS'But AEG lawyer Sabrina Strong called it "very speculative" that Jackson would have even finished the 50 London shows before dying.'
p834
aS'AEG lawyers argued that Jackson didn\'t perform 260 shows and make that much money even in his prime. "He never came anywhere close to that," Strong said. "No one other than Cher has ever done that."'
p835
aS'Erk also calculated Jackson would have followed with four more world tours before he turned 65.'
p836
aS'Palazuelos weighed in during a hearing on Thursday, noting that the Rolling Stones are still touring into their 70s.'
p837
aS'The Jacksons will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of Las Vegas shows, endorsements, a clothing line and movies.'
p838
aS'Strong argued that Jackson had a history of failed projects and missed opportunities, calling Erk\'s projections "a hope, a dream, and not a basis for damages."'
p839
aS'Erk, under the new ruling, will be able to tell jurors about the\xc2\xa0"loss of earning capacity" suffered by the family because of Jackson\'s death. \xc2\xa0This means the jury can consider the Jackson argument that he\xc2\xa0could have earned millions with a clothing line, endorsements and movies.

aS"AEG can argue, however, that Jackson's past failures diminished the potential earnings."
p841
aS'None of the Jackson experts can offer an opinion on the question of whether Murray was hired by AEG.'
p842
aS'The witness lists include many members of the Jackson family, including Katherine Jackson. Other celebrity witnesses on the list are Sharon Osbourne , Quincy Jones, Spike Lee, Ray Parker Jr., Lisa Marie Presley, Diana Ross and Lou Ferrigno.'

Rana\'s capture was announced by loudspeaker at the disaster site, drawing cheers and applause from those awaiting the outcome of a continuing search-and-rescue operation for survivors of Wednesday\'s collapse. Many of those killed were workers at clothing factories in the building, known as the Rana Plaza, and the collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy. The fire that broke out late Sunday night sent smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and halted some of the rescue efforts \xe2\x80\x94 including a bid to free a woman who was found trapped in the rubble.

It forced them to retreat while firefighters frantically hosed down the flames. Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed the trapped woman, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam.

He did not speak during the 10-minute appearance, and he is likely to be handed over to police, who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours. A small-time politician from the ruling Awami League party, Rana had been on the run since the building collapsed Wednesday. He last appeared in public Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared in the building. Witnesses said he assured tenants, including five garment factories, that the building was safe. Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said the next phase of the search involved heavy equipment such as hydraulic cranes that were brought to the disaster site Sunday. Searchers had been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels, he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. "We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones," Suhrawardy said.

S'Updated 6:00 p.m. ET SAVAR, Bangladesh A fire broke out late Sunday in the wreckage of the garment factory that collapsed last week in Bangladesh, with smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and some of the rescue efforts forced to stop. The fire came four days after the collapse, as rescuers were trying to free a woman they found trapped in the rubble. The flames broke out when sparks were generated by those rescuers trying to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer rescuer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescue workers were injured in the fire as they frantically tried to hose down the flames, he said. CBS News correspondent Kelly Cobiella reports rescuers returned to the woman after the fire was out, but she had died. They were still trying to reach any possible survivors in other parts of the destroyed eight-story building. "We\'ve evacuated many people dead and alive, he said, but in some cases it\'s not possible," said Nurul Islam of the fire brigade. The fire came hours after the owner of the illegally-constructed building was captured Sunday at a border crossing with India. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested in Benapole in western Bangladesh, just as he was about to flee into India\'s West Bengal state, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Cobiella reports he is accused of building the factory on soggy, sandy ground and building three floors without permits. 33 Photos Rana\'s capture brought cheers and applause when it was announced on a loudspeaker at the site of the collapsed building in the Dhaka suburb of Savar. The death toll in Wednesday collapse is close to 400 and hundreds more are still missing. The death toll is expected to rise but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh\'s garment industry, which is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy. The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands. Bangladesh\'s garment industry was the third largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. The country\'s minimum wage is the equivalent of about $38 a month.'

S'JURAIN, Bangladesh (AP) \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94 Dozens of Bangladeshi garment workers whose bodies were too battered or decomposed to be identified were buried in a mass funeral, a week after the eight-story building they worked in collapsed, killing more than 400 people and injuring thousands. Hundreds attended the traditional Muslim funeral and many more watched from the roofs of nearby buildings Wednesday as the bodies, rotting in the spring heat, were brought to the graveyard on the back of flatbed trucks. Onlookers covered their noses. One woman rushed through the crowd to the back of a truck wailing that one body was her sister\'s. She begged to take it as family members held her to keep her from collapsing. Local men and boys recited a prayer for the dead. Then, 34 bodies were unloaded and placed in the graves. Cemetery workers have dug several long rows of graves where scores more unidentified bodies are expected to be buried in the coming days. Police said Thursday morning that 10 more bodies were recovered overnight, bringing the death toll to 420. Rescue workers believe many more bodies are still buried on the ground level of the building. They said it could take another five days to clear tons of rubble with cranes and cutting machines. "I would not have to take part in this if the government acted more responsibly," said Rasel Islam, a 32-year-old man who attended the burial. Five garment factories were housed in the illegally constructed Rana Plaza building that collapsed April 24. The disaster and a garment factory fire five months earlier that killed 112 people exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh\'s $20 billion-a-year garment industry that supplies many global retailers. At the Vatican, Pope Francis said he was shocked that some of the workers were living on 38 euros ($50) a month. "This was the payment of these people who have died ... and this is called \'slave labor,\'" he said. Vatican Radio said the pope made the remarks during a private Mass at the Vatican. "Not paying a just (wage), not providing work, focusing exclusively on the balance books, on financial statements, only looking at making personal profit. That goes against God!" Francis was quoted as saying. He added: "People are less important than the things that give profit to those who have political, social, economic power. What point have we come to? To the point that we are not aware of this dignity of the person; this dignity of labor." EU officials said they are considering action including changes to Bangladesh\'s duty-free and quota-free access to the giant EU market to "incentivize" responsible management of the nation\'s garment industry. Catherine Ashton, the EU\'s foreign affairs chief, and its trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, called in a statement for Bangladesh authorities to act immediately to ensure factories comply with international labor standards. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said businesses operating in the Rana Plaza appeared to have links to numerous companies in the U.S. and Europe. "We\'ll continue to engage with U.S. companies to discuss what role they can play in improving conditions," he told reporters. He did not give details on the companies. Pressure built inside Bangladesh as well, as a raucous May Day procession of workers on foot, pickup trucks and motorcycles wound its way through central Dhaka demanding safe working conditions and capital punishment for the building\'s owner. They waved the national flag and banners, beat drums and chanted "Direct action!" and "Death penalty!" From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the group: "My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless." Some confusion remains over how many people are missing. Zillur Rahman Chowdhury, a Dhaka district administrator, said so far 149 people have been listed missing. A police official, Aminur Rahman, said police have recorded up to 1,300 names as missing, but he cautioned that many may be duplicates. "We will now have to screen the names by computer to find the actual number," he said. The owner of the building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, is under arrest and expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work, which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail. Authorities have not said if more serious crimes will be added. Protesters demanded capital punishment for Rana, 38, a small-time political operative with the ruling Awami League party. "I want the death penalty for the owner of the building. We want regular salaries, raises and absolutely we want better safety in our factories," said Mongidul Islam Rana, 18, who works in a different garment factory. The Bangladesh High Court has ordered the government to confiscate Rana\'s property and freeze the assets of the owners of the factories in Rana Plaza so the money can be used to pay the salaries of their workers. Rana had permission to build five stories but added three more illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the building a day before its collapse, police ordered an evacuation, but Rana told tenants it was safe. The next day, a bank and some shops refused to open but factory managers told their workers to go back in. Hours later the building came down in a heap of concrete. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. ___ Hossain wrote from Dhaka.'

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 A fire broke out late Sunday in the wreckage of the garment factory that collapsed last week in Bangladesh, with smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and some of the rescue efforts forced to stop. The fire came four days after the collapse, as rescuers were trying to free a woman they found trapped in the rubble. The flames broke out when sparks were generated by those rescuers trying to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer rescuer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescue workers were injured in the fire, he said. Rescuers have retreated from the part of the wreckage where the fire erupted, but were still trying to reach any possible survivors in other parts of the destroyed eight-story building. Firefighters were frantically hosing down the flames. "Hopefully we will be able to control it," said Brig. Gen. Mohammed Siddiqul Alam Shikder, who is overseeing rescue operations. It wasn\'t immediately clear what happened to the trapped woman. The fire came hours after the owner of the illegally-constructed building was captured Sunday at a border crossing with India. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested in Benapole in western Bangladesh, just as he was about to flee into India\'s West Bengal state, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Rana\'s capture brought cheers and applause when it was announced on a loudspeaker at the site of the collapsed building in the Dhaka suburb of Savar. At least 377 people are confirmed to have died in the Wednesday collapse. Three of the building\'s floors were built illegally. The death toll is expected to rise but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh\'s garment industry, which is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy. The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands.

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh (AP) -- The fugitive owner of an illegally constructed building that collapsed and killed at least 377 people was captured by commandos as he tried to flee into India. At the disaster site, meanwhile, fire broke out in the rubble and forced authorities to suspend the search for survivors temporarily. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested Sunday in the western border town of Benapole, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital of Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Rana\'s capture was announced by loudspeaker at the disaster site, drawing cheers and applause from those awaiting the outcome of a continuing search-and-rescue operation for survivors of Wednesday\'s collapse. Many of those killed worked at clothing factories in the building, known as the Rana Plaza , and the collapse was the deadliest disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth $20 billion annually, supplies global retailers and is a mainstay of the economy. The fire that broke out late Sunday night sent smoke pouring from the piles of shattered concrete and halted some of the rescue efforts \xe2\x80\x94 including a bid to free a woman who was found trapped in the rubble. The blaze was caused by sparks as rescuers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach the woman, said a volunteer, Syed Al-Amin Roman. At least three rescuers were injured in the fire, he said. It forced them to retreat while firefighters frantically hosed down the flames. Officials believe the fire is likely to have killed the trapped woman, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Rescue workers had delayed the use of heavy equipment for several hours in the hope that she could be extricated from the rubble first. But with the woman presumed dead, they began using heavy equipment around midnight. An exhausted and disheveled Rana was brought before reporters briefly at the Dhaka headquarters of the commando team, the Rapid Action Battalion. Wearing a printed shirt, Rana was sweating as two security officers held him by his arms. A security official helped him to drink water after he gestured he was thirsty. He did not speak during the 10-minute appearance, and he is likely to be handed over to police, who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours. A small-time political operative from the ruling Awami League party, Rana had been on the run since the building collapsed Wednesday. He last appeared in public Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared in the building. Witnesses said Rana assured tenants, including five garment factories , that the building was safe. Police, however, ordered an evacuation. A bank and some first-floor shops closed, but managers of the garment factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts. Hours later, the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete. Local authorities said the construction permit was issued for a five-story building, not the eight floors that were built. Rana\'s arrest was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader. On Saturday, police arrested three owners of two factories. Also detained were Rana\'s wife and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for the building design. Local TV stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank accounts of the owners of all five garment factories in the Rana Plaza. A garment manufacturers\' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside when it fell. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for. Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said the next phase of the search involved the heavy equipment such as hydraulic cranes that were brought to the disaster site Sunday. Searchers had been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels, he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. "We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones," Suhrawardy said. In a rare bit of good news, a female worker was pulled out alive Sunday. Rescuer Hasan Akbari said when he tried to extricate a man next to the woman, "he said his body was being torn apart. So I had to let go. But God willing, we will be able to rescue him with more help very soon." The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands. The death toll surpassed a fire five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed in Bangladesh. Its garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain\'s Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them. Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorized to be made in the facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorized production. __ AP writers Farid Hossain and Gillian Wong in Dhaka contributed to this report.'

S'SAVAR, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 The mother stood at the edge of the wreckage, pressing her lips to photos of her two children \xe2\x80\x94 Asma, who had worked in a garment factory on the fourth floor, and Sultan, who worked on the fifth. For five days after the building collapsed, rescue teams had retrieved corpses and survivors, but not her son and daughter. Tears on her cheeks, she began to shout: at a soldier sweating beneath a hard hat, at the shattered building, at her god, and finally at her children, calling out their names, beckoning to them, \xe2\x80\x9cToday, I\xe2\x80\x99m here! But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t come back!\xe2\x80\x9d Thousands of people surrounded the site on Sunday, watching the huge rescue operation, even as hopes faded that many more victims would be found alive. For nearly 12 hours, rescuers tried to save a trapped woman, lowering dry food and juice to her as they carefully cut through the wreckage trying to reach her. But then a fire broke out, apparently killing the woman, leaving many firefighters in tears. With national outrage boiling over, Bangladeshi paramilitary officers tracked down and arrested Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was hiding near the Indian border, and returned him by helicopter to Dhaka. When loudspeakers at the rescue site announced his capture earlier in the day, local news reports said, the crowd broke out in cheers. The collapse of the building, the Rana Plaza, is considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. It is known to have claimed at least 377 lives, and hundreds more workers are thought to be missing still, buried in the rubble. The Rana Plaza building contained five garment factories, employing more than 3,000 workers, who were making clothing for European and American consumers. Labor activists, citing customs records, company Web sites or labels discovered in the wreckage, say that the factories produced clothing for JC Penney; Cato Fashions; Benetton; Primark, the low-cost British store chain; and other retailers. Everywhere near the building, the stench of death was overpowering. Men in surgical masks sprayed disinfectant in the air. Others sprayed air freshener. At one point, the police said, searches inside the structure were suspended because some rescuers were overcome by dust and the odor of decomposing bodies. Savar is a crowded industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and the disaster has overwhelmed local institutions. A high school near Rana Plaza is now a staging ground for the identification of corpses. Nazma Begum, 25, stood beside a crude coffin that contained the remains of her sister, Shamima. She was standing guard over it until her father arrived to take the sister back to their home village to be buried. Sticks of burning incense had been wedged into the coffin to fight the awful smell. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped that my sister was still alive,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that hope is now shattered.\xe2\x80\x9d Like so many young women in the country, the two sisters had gotten work in garment factories to help support their families. Ms. Begum makes about $85 a month; her sister made $56. Now Ms. Begum wants to quit her job. She has heard rumors that the building where she works is unsafe. Just then a group of young men placed another coffin nearby, slid open the wooden lid and sprayed the body with disinfectant. A man on a megaphone made an announcement: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a new body,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as a crowd surged toward the coffin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come and see the body to identify it.\xe2\x80\x9d For days, rescuers crawled though pancaked spaces on their hands and knees, afraid that using heavy machinery would collapse the building further. Lowered precariously into holes, they called out through the rubble and the darkness, listening for the voices of survivors. Many were saved in the painstaking process. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were shouting, asking if anyone was alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharif ul-Islam, 35, a firefighter. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would say, \xe2\x80\x98If anyone is alive, please make a sound! We will come to you!\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Finding and identifying all the missing may take weeks or longer. Thousands of homemade posters for missing loved ones have been affixed to the walls outside the school, to nearby buildings, to the branches of trees, to the gate of Enam Medical College and Hospital, where so many victims are being treated. The posters have a poignant similarity: One husband, Mohammed Siddique, is looking for his wife, Shahida Akter. She is smiling in her photograph, posing with a cellphone. Another husband is looking for Alpana Rani. She is smiling in her photograph, too, holding her daughter. In his ground-floor office, the director of Enam Hospital, Dr. Mohammed Anawarul Quader Nazim, said that more than 650 survivors had been brought in since the Wednesday morning disaster. The scope of injuries was horrifying: fractured skulls, crushed rib cages, severed livers, ruptured spleens. One survivor lost both legs. So many people suffered crushed limbs that his hospital sent a medical team to the wreckage to help handle on-site amputations. He keeps a list of amputees on his desk: A teenage girl named Sania lost her right leg. Another teenager, Anna, lost her right hand. Upstairs in the Intensive Care Unit, Laboni Khanam, 22, lay in a bed, dazed. She was rescued after being trapped for 36 hours, but to save her life, rescuers had to amputate her left arm, which was pinned beneath a pillar. She begged them to save her arm but they told her they had no choice. They gave her an anesthetic but the agony was excruciating. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t describe how painful it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cMy life is ruined now.\xe2\x80\x9d With so many lives ruined or lost, public anger has largely focused on Mr. Rana, the building\xe2\x80\x99s owner. Garment industry leaders have blamed him for lying about the structural safety of the building; when cracks were discovered the day before the disaster, Mr. Rana is accused of assuring factory bosses that the building was safe to operate. After his arrest, Mr. Rana blamed the owners of the garment factories for insisting on operating the morning of the disaster. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not force the owners,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, according to bdnews24.com , an online news source in Bangladesh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was them who forced me, saying they would face huge losses, and shipments would be canceled if the factories were closed for even one day.\xe2\x80\x9d The Rana Plaza disaster, coming five months after 112 garment workers died in a fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory, has brought renewed criticism of the failure of Western brands to ensure safe working conditions in the factories they use in Bangladesh. In recent days, different Western brands have expressed sorrow over the accident but none, as yet, has endorsed proposals for tougher independent safety inspection programs. Soon, the rescue efforts at Rana Plaza will likely come to a close and the operation will shift toward clearing the rubble. Late on Sunday night, rescuers started using two cranes and other heavy machinery. Officials are suggesting that few, if any, are likely still alive. Yet there are still thousands of people clinging to hope. A young wife who managed to escape the fourth floor was sitting on the ground, holding a photo of her husband, who had been working on the third floor. And another woman sat less than 50 yards from the building, crying, surrounded by invoices from garment orders that were scattered on the ground. When a soldier asked her to move somewhere safer and farther away from the wreckage, she wailed at him. She had two sons somewhere inside the building. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better if you killed me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan if you asked me to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d'

With more than 800 people still missing and time running out, rescue officials fear the number could rise sharply. [Updated 11:45 a.m. PDT, April 28: Fire broke out in the collapsed building late Sunday night local time, Associated Press reported, forcing a halt to rescue efforts as smoke poured from the stacked slabs of concrete. A rescuer told AP that the fire began when workers tried to cut through a steel rod to reach a trapped woman, and sparks ignited the wreckage. The extent of the fire was not immedately clear. ] Sohel Rana, landlord of the pancaked Rana Plaza, was trying to flee the country when he was detained in the border town of Benapole, police said. Rana is reportedly an official with the ruling party who went into hiding soon after he was rescued from the wreckage of his own building. Local news photos showed him wearing a black and white printed shirt as he was taken into custody by two men in plain clothes. "He has been arrested and will be tried," Bangladesh\'s deputy home minister, Shamsul Haque Tuku, told reporters. Rana Plaza, housing five apparel factories supplying western brands, a shopping plaza and a bank branch, developed cracks Tuesday, according to local media reports. Police condemned the eight-story building, but some factory owners reportedly ordered workers back to their sewing machines just hours before the massive structure collapsed. Reports said an illegal ninth story was under construction. Disaster Management Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali said Sunday the structure didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet building code requirements, was never approved by the government and was built on a wetland using substandard construction materials. The revelations are likely to fan public outrage that\xe2\x80\x99s been burning for days. In addition to Rana, authorities have arrested three factory owners and two government engineers in the growing national crisis.\xc2\xa0 Local media reported that Rana\xe2\x80\x99s mother died of a heart attack on Saturday evening. Meanwhile, fewer people are being pulled out alive with each passing day. The five rescued Sunday compared with approximately two dozen on Saturday and more than 70 on Friday. "The chances of finding people alive are dimming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hassan Sohrawardi, the army official coordinating the rescue operation. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we have to step up our rescue operation to save any valuable life we can." Local television footage showed large cranes parked outside the building. Authorities initially announced they would suspend the rescue operation and start removing the debris at the 72-hour mark, but angry relatives forced them to continue searching. As the stench of decaying bodies grows, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before the focus shifts to a cleanup operation, analysts said. Nine more survivors were spotted under massive pieces of concrete Sunday, spurring an operation to reach them. So far, 2,440 people have been pulled out alive, Dhaka\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Star newspaper reports. The roads were relatively quiet Sunday, with protests limited to a few blocked highways. This followed days of demonstrations and clashes between police and angry garment workers who burned factories, smashed cars and wrecked shops. Opposition forces have called for a national strike Thursday to protest the disaster. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the time for agitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday on a day in which she visited hospitals and promised aid in a bid to stem the civil and political fallout. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the time to stand beside other people. Vandalism on the streets is not acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d Bangladesh has seen a string of fires and collapses affecting the textile and apparel industry, which accounts for 80% of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s $24 billion in exports. The poor safety record, low wages and concerns over worker safety have spotlighted the human price paid for inexpensive western clothing.

S'While authorities have not said the raid Sunday had anything to do with the Boston Marathon bombing, one of those killed was an associate of Abu Dujan, the slain leader of a militant islamist organization that produced at least one video that slain bombing suspect Tamarlan Tsarnaev apparently posted and later removed from a social media account, according to a nalysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Group . Videos linked to the group show how to make homemade explosive devices, among other things. U.S. investigators have been looking into whether Tsarnaev could have been influenced by such groups during his six-month visit to the region in 2012. The interplay between U.S. officials and their counterparts in Russia -- who have been battling islamist militants in the region for years -- has emerged as a key thread in discussions surrounding the April 15 Boston bombing, which killed three and left more than 260 wounded. Authorities say Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, also shot a police officer to death. Over the weekend, an official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Russian authorities had intercepted a phone call in early 2011 from one of the Tsarnaev brothers in the U.S. to their mother in Dagestan. The wiretapped communication discussed jihad but the conversation was vague, according to two U.S. officials. It\'s unclear why the Russians were eavesdropping on the mother or for how long. CNN has previously reported that the FBI conducted an investigation -- including an interview with Tsarnaev -- after Russia expressed concerns in 2011. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev\'s mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, according to several sources. Her name was subsequently added to a terrorism database along with her son\'s, an intelligence official said last week. The FBI said at the time it found nothing to justify further investigation and that Russia did not respond to U.S .requests for more information. The case was closed after several months. One of the officials declined to say whether the information from the wiretapped phone call would have made a difference in uncovering plans for a future attack on the U.S. However, CNN contributor Tom Fuentes says the FBI would have found that information helpful after Russians officials asked agency to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev for a possible shift toward increasing Islamic extremism. On Monday, Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN\'s Nick Paton Walsh that she plans to come to the United States if she can see her son -- despite pending shoplifting charges against her in Massachusetts. The 19-year-old suspect is now at Federal Medical Center Devens , about 40 miles west of Boston. Authorities moved him there last week from Boston\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. He is able to speak and has been interacting with staff, a prison spokesman said. He has, however, apparently been less talkative since authorities read him his Miranda rights three days after his capture. But the information the hein two sessions of questioning has produced good leads, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. In other developments over the weekend: -- Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that he was comfortable with the handling of the initial questioning of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at a Boston hospital. A magistrate\'s decision to read him his constitutitional rights was "totally consistent with the laws that we have," Holder said. "We have a two-day period to question him under the \'public safety\' exception. So I think everything was done appropriately, and we got good leads." -- Authorities have finished combing a New Beford, Massachusetts, landfill for clues that may shed light on the bloody attack, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller. She wouldn\'t say whether investigators turned up anything. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had said investigators were looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\'s laptop computer. Tsarnaev led authorities to look there, the source said, and others who may have knowledge of the computer\'s whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that prompted the search. -- The boat where Tsarnaev was captured in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home has been taken to an undisclosed location to be thoroughly examined, according to the FBI. Russia intercepted a communication between the mother of the accused Boston Marathon bombers and someone who may have been one of her sons "discussing jihad" in 2011, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. This source described the conversation as vague. The Russians turned over the intercept to the FBI in the past few days, the official said. This source was not aware of a reason for the delay and did not offer an opinion about whether it would have given the FBI enough reason to justify a closer look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the oldest of the two brothers suspected of killing three people near the finish of the marathon on April 15. More than 260 people also were injured as a result of the two blasts, and 28 remain hospitalized after nearly two weeks. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was asked about the report while attending the White House Correspondents\' Dinner on Saturday. "That\'s an ongoing matter," Holder said. "I can\'t really comment on that." CNN has previously reported that the FBI has said that it conducted an investigation -- including an interview with Tsarnaev after Russia expressed concerns in 2011. The FBI said at the time it found nothing to justify pursuing the matter further and that Russia did not respond to U.S .requests for more information. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev\'s mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, when they approached the U.S. about concerns regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to several sources. The mother\'s name was subsequently added to Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database at the same time as her son\'s, an intelligence official said Thursday.\xc2\xa0TIDE is a collection of more than a half-million names of suspected terrorists maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center.\xc2\xa0 The FBI interviewed the mother in 2011 as part of the investigation into her son. The case was closed after several months. Holder also responded to criticism that the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was read his Miranda rights. "The decision to Mirandize him was one that the magistrate made and that was totally consistent with the laws that we have," Holder said. "We have a two-day period to question him under the \'public safety\' exception. So I think everything was done appropriately, and we got good leads." Officials also believe Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier was killed by one or both of the brothers three days after the marathon attack, leading to the manhunt in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed. In developments Monday, Russian special forces killed two members of a jihadist group during an early morning raid in Dagestan, a semi-autonomous republic in southern Russia, two Russian police sources told CNN. One of those killed, Shakhrudin Askhabov, was a close associate of Abu Dujan, the islamist group\'s leader. Analysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Group last week said Tsarnaev appears to have posted and removed a video from Abu Dujan. Videos linked to the group show how to prepare homemade explosives from almost anywhere. No official connection has been made by investigators between the Tsarnaev brothers and the Abu Dujan group. FBI: Search of dump tied to suspect ends Since the pair of blasts turned celebratory cheers into screams of horror at the Boston Marathon\'s finish line, investigators keep working -- interviewing people and searching for evidence, even when it meant sifting through trash -- to find out why. One of the most recent focuses of the probe has been at a landfill in New Bedford, Massachusetts, adjacent to the town where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended school at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Authorities have finished combing the dump for clues that may shed light on the bloody attack, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, who wouldn\'t say whether investigators turned up anything. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had said investigators were looking for Tsarnaev\'s laptop computer. Tsarnaev led authorities to look there, the source said, and others who may have knowledge of the computer\'s whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that prompted the search. A boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home where Tsarnaev was captured has been taken to an undisclosed location, to be thoroughly examined, according to the FBI. Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said the investigation remains open, with interviews and the search for evidence continuing. The 19-year-old suspect is now at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Devens , the federal inmate medical center to which he was transferred from Boston\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. Tsarnaev has been less talkative since authorities read him his Miranda rights three days after his capture. But the information the teenager gave investigators in two sessions of questioning has produced good leads, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Photos: Galleries from the attack and aftermath Family in Russia The brothers\' mother said Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, had said he\'d planned to travel to the United States. But that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons. The mother will not be flying to the United States, where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. The family lived in Massachusetts before Zubeidat Tsarnaev jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year. Suspects\' mother describes her last conversation with her sons Zubeidat Tsarnaev has denied the reality of the bombing. She believes it was fake. She said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea, and that there was no blood, that paint was used instead. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows Botched hijacking thwarts plans to head to New Yor k Three days after the marathon attack, and hours after authorities released images of the two suspects, they spontaneously decided to go to New York\'s Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators. But a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined by New York\'s police commissioner. Before forcing their way into a vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers shot dead a campus police officer at MIT, police said. The vehicle they subsequently hijacked, a Mercedes sport utility vehicle, ran low on fuel, and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle\'s owner escaped. Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV and pursued it. Authorities say the men threw bombs out the vehicle\'s window at them. The gunbattle and Tamerlan Tsarnaev\'s death followed.

S'The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional rights to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, officials said Wednesday. It is unclear whether those statements before the Miranda rights warning would be admissible in a criminal trial and, if not, whether prosecutors even need them to win a conviction. Officials said physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene. The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough. The U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press were close to the investigation but insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters. Tamerlan, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries sustained during a getaway attempt. Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured. More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as "two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis." Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said. How much of those conversations will end up in court is unclear. The FBI normally tells suspects they have the right to remain silent before questioning them so all their statements can be used against them. Under pressure from Congress, however, the Department of Justice has said investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about that. Regardless, investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. An FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that." Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said. The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat. Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, "I\'m not going to talk about that." Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report. "Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him." Schwartz said. "And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... \xc2\xa0To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn\'t change anything for me." Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty. The suspects\' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan\'s body back to Russia. In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers\' parents, hoping to gain more information. Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia\'s turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade. At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing. The line of mourners stretched for a half-mile. They had to make their way through tight security, including metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs. Boston native James Taylor sang "The Water is Wide" and led a sing-along of "Shower the People." Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting. "The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it\'s going to be OK," Biden said. "When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye." The vice president also sounded a defiant note. "The purpose of terror is to instill fear," he said. "You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world." In another milestone in Boston\'s recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed. "I don\'t think there\'s going to be a sense of normalcy for a while," Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. "There are scars here that will be with us for a long time." \xc2\xa0'

S'NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 The Boston Marathon bombers were headed for New York\xe2\x80\x99s Times Square to blow up the rest of their explosives, authorities said Thursday, in what they portrayed as a chilling, spur-of-the-moment scheme that fell apart when the brothers realized the car they had hijacked was low on gas. \xe2\x80\x9cNew York City was next on their list of targets,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators from his hospital bed that he and his older brother decided on the spot last Thursday night to drive to New York and launch an attack. In their stolen SUV they had five pipe bombs and a pressure-cooker explosive like the ones that blew up at the marathon, Kelly said. But when the Tsarnaev brothers stopped at a gas station on the outskirts of Boston, the carjacking victim they were holding hostage escaped and called police, Kelly said. Later that night, police intercepted the brothers in a blazing gunbattle that left 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from Boston,\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just thankful that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to find out that answer.\xe2\x80\x9d The news caused New Yorkers to shudder with the thought that the city may have narrowly escaped another terrorist attack, though whether the brothers could have made it to the city is an open question. They were two of the most-wanted men in the world, their faces splashed all over the Internet and TV in surveillance-camera images released by the FBI hours earlier. Dzhokhar, 19, is charged with carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing April 15 that killed three people and wounded more than 260, and he could get the death penalty. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz in Boston, would not comment on whether authorities plan to add charges based on the alleged plot to attack New York. Investigators and lawmakers briefed by the FBI have said the Tsarnaev brothers \xe2\x80\x94 ethnic Chechens from Russia who had lived in the U.S. for about a decade \xe2\x80\x94 were motivated by anger over the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Based on the younger man\xe2\x80\x99s interrogation and other evidence, authorities have said it appears so far that the brothers were radicalized via Islamic jihadi material on the Internet instead of any direct contact with terrorist organizations, but they warned that it is still not certain. Dzhokhar was interrogated in his hospital room Sunday and Monday over a period of 16 hours without being read his rights to remain silent and have an attorney present.

S'Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the FBI about his role in the Boston Marathon bombings before he was read his Miranda rights, two U.S. officials said Wednesday. WASHINGTON \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings acknowledged to the FBI his role in the attacks but did so before he was advised of his constitutional right to keep quiet and seek a lawyer, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his rights on Monday, he immediately stopped talking, according to four officials of both political parties who were briefed on the interrogation but insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private. After roughly 16 hours of questioning, investigators were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney\'s office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, the four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. It is unclear whether any of this will matter in court since the FBI says Tsarnaev confessed to a witness and U.S. officials said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the scene. But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering. Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment." Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack, two U.S. officials said. The CIA, however, named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, officials said Wednesday, an acknowledgment that will undoubtedly prompt congressional inquiry about whether investigators took warnings from Russian intelligence officials seriously enough. The U.S. officials who discussed the terrorist database and other details of the investigation are in addition to those who discussed the Miranda warning. They were close to the investigation and insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case with reporters. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom authorities have described as the driving force behind the plot, was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt. AP Photo: vk.com. Boston bombing suspect unarmed: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has reportedly remained quiet since being read his constitutional rights. Authorities had previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour Friday night before they captured him inside a boat covered by a tarp in a suburban Boston neighborhood backyard. But two U.S. officials said Wednesday that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured. More than 4,000 mourners at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as "two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis." Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said. Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty. Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that." Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of a Thursday night gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said. The officials told the AP that no gun was found in the boat. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat. Asked whether the suspect had a gun in the boat, Davis said, "I\'m not going to talk about that." Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, did respond to the report. "Within half a mile of where this person was captured, a police officer was shot. And I know who shot him." Schwartz said. "And there were three bombs that went off, and I know where those bombs came from. ... To me, it does not change anything. This guy was captured alive and will survive. True or not true, it doesn\'t change anything for me." The suspects\' parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, plan to fly to the U.S. from Russia on Thursday, the father was quoted as telling the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The family has said it wants to take Tamerlan\'s body back to Russia. In Russia, U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan and were in contact with the brothers\' parents, hoping to gain more information. Investigators are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia\'s turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade. More from MSN News Tsarnaev to be tried in federal court Boston chief: More attacks were likely planned Governor: Video shows bomb suspect dodging blast As it happened: The 5-day manhunt for Boston suspects Photos changed suspects\' behavior, breaking case open While in the U.S., the brothers received welfare benefits. The Office of Health and Human Services in Massachusetts confirmed a Boston Herald report Wednesday that Tamerlan, his wife and daughter had received welfare benefits up until last year, when he became ineligible based on family income. The state also says Tamerlan and his brother received welfare benefits as children through their parents while the family lived in Massachusetts. Neither was receiving benefits at the time of the bombing. At MIT, bagpipes wailed as students, faculty and staff members and throngs of law enforcement officials paid their respects to MIT police Officer Sean Collier, who was ambushed in his cruiser three days after the bombing. Biden told the Collier family that no child should die before his or her parents, but that, in time, the grief will lose some of its sting. "The moment will come when the memory of Sean is triggered and you know it\'s going to be OK," Biden said. "When the first instinct is to get a smile on your lips before a tear to your eye." The vice president also sounded a defiant note. "The purpose of terror is to instill fear," he said. "You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world." In another milestone in Boston\'s recovery, the area around the marathon finish line was reopened to the public, with fresh cement still drying on the repaired sidewalk. Delivery trucks made their way down Boylston Street under a heavy police presence, though some damaged stores were still closed. "I don\'t think there\'s going to be a sense of normalcy for a while," Tom Champoux, who works nearby, said as he pointed to the boarded-up windows. "There are scars here that will be with us for a long time." \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 MSN News on Facebook and Twitter Stay up to date on breaking news and current events.

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Federal agents had to end what they termed "an urgent public safety interview" with Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when a judge came to his hospital room, officials said Thursday, a disclosure that has renewed the debate over how the government should handle terrorism suspects. Tsarnaev has not answered any questions since he was given a lawyer and told he has the right to remain silent by Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler on Monday, officials said. For The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday, April 27, 2013 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 Local Desk 1 inches; 47 words Type of Material: Correction Boston bombings: In the April 26 Section A, an article about the Boston bombings identified Eugene Fidell, a legal expert on U.S. military law, as a professor at the Yale School of Law. He is a lecturer at the school, which is known as Yale Law School. Until that point, Tsarnaev had been responding to the interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, including admitting his role in the bombing, authorities said. A senior congressional aide said Tsarnaev had asked several times for a lawyer, but that request was ignored since he was being questioned under the public safety exemption to the Miranda rule. The exemption allows defendants to be questioned about imminent threats, such as whether other plots are in the works or other plotters are on the loose. After being briefed on the sequence of events, lawmakers from both parties questioned Thursday why the Justice Department didn\'t seek to delay the judge\'s appearance on the grounds that the public safety interview was continuing. Legal experts said that once documents charging Tsarnaev with using a weapon of mass destruction were signed Sunday night, criminal rules of procedure require that he be brought before a judge "without unnecessary delay," which usually means the next business day. Lawmakers were told Tsarnaev had been questioned for 16 hours over two days. Injured in the throat, he was answering mostly in writing. "For those of us who think the public safety exemption properly applies here, there are legitimate questions about why he was [brought before a judge] when he was," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), a former federal prosecutor who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the committee, wrote Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. asking for a full investigation of the matter, complaining that the court session "cut off a lawful, ongoing FBI interview to collect public safety information." Justice Department officials Thursday did not address the question of why they signed documents charging Tsarnaev on Sunday night, knowing that could start the clock ticking toward an appearance by a magistrate. Once that was done, they said, they had no legal way to stop the hearing from going forward. A congressional official said interrogators left the hospital room about an hour before the judge arrived, after they were told she was coming. Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said, "The prosecutors and FBI agents in Boston were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance." One Justice Department official put it another way: "You don\'t tell a federal judge to put off a hearing." Eugene Fidell, a professor at Yale School of Law, said it was past time for Tsarnaev to have been read his rights, because the Constitution requires it. "The notion that the public safety exemption was going to allow them all the time in the world is preposterous," he said.'

S'Updated 5:00 p.m. BOSTON Sixteen hours after investigators began interrogating him, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings went silent: He\'d just been read his constitutional rights. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev immediately stopped talking after a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney\'s office entered his hospital room and gave him his Miranda warning, a U.S. law enforcement source and four officials of both political parties briefed on the interrogation told The Associated Press. They insisted on anonymity because the briefing was private. The Department of Justice said the reading of Tsarnaev\'s Miranda rights was coordinated with prosecutors, the federal defender, the court reporter, the U.S. Marshal Service and the hospital. Before being advised of his rights, the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the attack that detonated pressure-cooker bombs at the marathon finish line, two U.S. officials said. Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video Play Video The CIA, however, had named Tamerlan to a terrorist database 18 months ago, a U.S. official told CBS News senior correspondent John Miller. The new disclosure that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was included within a huge, classified database of known and suspected terrorists before the attacks was expected to drive congressional inquiries in coming weeks about whether the Obama administration adequately investigated tips from Russia that Tsarnaev had posed a security threat. Shortly after the bombings, U.S. officials said the intelligence community had no information about threats to the marathon before the April 15 explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev died Friday in a police shootout hours before Dzhokhar was discovered hiding in a boat in a suburban backyard. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis had said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat, but Miller has reported that the suspect was unarmed when captured by police. Police fired upon the boat after one officer on high ground saw the tarp covering the boat flip up and a hand come out holding an object, Miller reports. The officer thought the object was a bomb, prompting him to fire some rounds at the suspect. Other officers believed the object was a gun and the shots came from him, so they fired on the boat. Washington is piecing together what happened and whether there were any unconnected dots buried in U.S. government files that, if connected, could have prevented the bombings. Lawmakers who were briefed by the FBI said they have more questions than answers about the investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said lawmakers intend to pursue whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing, though Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said he "hasn\'t seen any red flags thus far." U.S. officials were expected to brief the Senate on the investigation Thursday. The suspects\' father said Thursday that he is leaving Russia for the United States in the next day or two, but their mother said she was still thinking it over. Anzor Tsarnaev has expressed a desire to go to the U.S. to find out what happened with his sons, defend his hospitalized 19-year-old son Dzhokhar and if possible bring his older son\'s body back to Russia for burial. Their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who was charged with shoplifting in the U.S. last summer, said she has been assured by lawyers that she would not be arrested, but was still deciding whether to go. It is unclear whether the issue of their younger son\'s constitutional rights will matter since the FBI say he confessed to a witness. U.S. officials also said Wednesday that physical evidence, including a 9 mm handgun and pieces of a remote-control device commonly used in toys, was recovered from the bombing scene. But the debate over whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a major sticking point in the debate over how best to fight terrorism. Many Republicans, in particular, believe Miranda warnings are designed to build court cases, and only hinder intelligence gathering. Christina DiIorio Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, said in an email late Wednesday, "This remains an ongoing investigation and we don\'t have any further comment." Investigators have said the brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist group. Play Video Play Video Play Video U.S. investigators traveled to the predominantly Muslim province of Dagestan in Russia and were in contact with the brothers\' parents, hoping to gain more information. They are looking into whether Tamerlan, who spent six months in Russia\'s turbulent Caucasus region in 2012, was influenced by the religious extremists who have waged an insurgency against Russian forces in the area for years. The brothers have roots in Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya but had lived in the U.S. for about a decade. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said. Dzhokhar\'s public defender had no comment on the matter Wednesday. His father has called him a "true angel," and an aunt has insisted he\'s not guilty. Investigators have found pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them, officials said. One official described the detonator as "close-controlled," meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. That evidence could be key to the court case. And an FBI affidavit said one of the brothers told a carjacking victim during their getaway attempt, "Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that." Officials also recovered a 9 mm handgun believed to have been used by Tamerlan from the site of an April 18 gunbattle that injured a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, two U.S. officials said.

S'By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal officials vowed on Monday to ensure the safety of climbers seeking to scale Mount Everest after three European climbers were involved in a fight with sherpa guides on their way to the peak of the world\'s highest mountain. Three experienced climbers from Britain, Italy and Switzerland were on route to camp three at 7,000 meters (22,965 feet) on the 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) Everest summit when a brawl broke out on Saturday with sherpas fixing their ropes. Witnesses said the sherpas pelted the Europeans\' tents with stones and punches were thrown. Swiss climber Ueli Steck descended to the base camp after the attack and said he would abandon the climb and return to Kathmandu if proper security was not ensured. Nepali officials were quick to respond after the unusual brawl on Mount Everest, which is a key source of income for impoverished Nepal as foreign climbers pay royalties to scale the world\'s highest peak. Tourism Ministry official Dipendra Paudel said the government would ensure the safety and security of the climbers. "There was a slight misunderstanding and communication gap between them," Paudel said in Kathmandu after contacting the base camp. "This has been sorted out and the climbers are at the base camp." He said the European climbers would resume their bid to climb Everest. Officials said hundreds of climbers from 32 expeditions and their sherpas were on Mount Everest in the current climbing season which continues through May. Sherpas are locals from the Everest region and are noted for their climbing skills. They are responsible for fixing ropes and accompany most of the foreign climbers to the summit. Beni Hyoju, an official of the Cho-Oyu Trekking agency that organized the expedition, said the three European climbers had failed to comply with a request from their sherpa guides to stay at a location while the guides fixed the route. Hyoju said this made the sherpas unhappy and they attacked the climbers. No one was critically wounded. "(Steck) has now agreed to continue the climb after local administration assured proper security," Hyoju said. "Sherpas who were responsible for the fight will offer (an) apology." Historian Elizabeth Hawley, who has been tracking foreign expeditions to Mount Everest for more than five decades, said this type of fighting on the mountain was rare. "I have not heard of any such incident before," said Hawley. About 4,000 climbers have reached the top of Everest since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Also on Yahoo!

S'But a group of three climbers say they faced unexpected adversaries over the weekend while scaling the storied peak: Sherpa guides. Nepalese authorities say they\'re investigating reports that a fight broke out on Saturday between the guides and the climbers, nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) up the world\'s tallest mountain. "If the Sherpas hit the foreign climbers, action will definitely be taken against them," said Dipendra Poudel, a mountaineering official in Kathmandu. The fight started after three professional climbers from Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland told the Sherpas they wanted to climb on their own, according to Nima Nuru Sherpa of Cho-Oyu Trekking, the agency that is managing their climb. "Our clients said the Sherpas manhandled them," he said. A statement posted Sunday on the website of Italian climber Simone Moro gave a harrowing account, claiming that 100 Sherpas attacked him, Swiss climber Ueli Steck and British climber Jonathan Griffith. This account said the fight broke out after Sherpas said the climbers knocked ice onto a Sherpa located below them. "They became instantly aggressive," the statement said, "and not only punched and kicked the climbers, but threw many rocks as well." After nearly an hour, the situation calmed down, the statement said. "The climbers, who had been pushed away and told to hide, had regrouped and were told that if they weren\'t gone in one hour that they would all be killed," the statement said. "The climbers packed the bare essentials and made a circuitous route back down to the base of Mount Everest in heavily crevassed terrain with no rope on, feeling that given the current situation this was the safest place to be." Nepalese authorities said their investigation into the report was ongoing. "The Sherpas got angry when hit by the ice and there was a fight," said Dambar Parajuli of the Expedition Operators\' Association, a group representing expedition organizers. In addition, he said, the climbers had been instructed not to go up while Sherpas were laying ropes, but they went ahead despite the warning. On Monday, he said, both sides had a meeting, reconciled and agreed to go ahead with the climb. In their statement on Sunday, the climbers said no Sherpa had come forward with any evidence of injury. "The climbers believe that the lead Sherpa was tired and cold and felt that his pride had been damaged as the three climbers were moving unroped and much faster to the side of him," the statement said. "Whatever the reason may be, there is no reason to instigate vigilante rule and to try and kill three visiting climbers." About 4,000 people have scaled Everest since Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first climbed the mountain in 1953. According to mountaineering officials, 340 foreign climbers from about 30 expeditions have been given permission to climb Everest this year with about the same number of high-altitude Sherpas set to assist them. The majority of climbers are on commercial expeditions and are aided by Sherpas to reach the summit. Sherpas from different expeditions put down ropes to the summit and later, other climbers hold on to them to scale the mountain. Turning Everest waste into art Among climbing enthusiasts on social media, word spread quickly of the fight in one of the world\'s most hard-to-reach, but well known, locales. In a Facebook post, Climb Magazine described what it called a "shocking scene" on the mountain , sparking debate among readers over whether the Sherpas or the climbers were responsible. One post on Adventure Journal\'s website described the incident as "an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on Mt. Everest." In another post, a guide said mistakes were likely made on both sides , but that those responsible for the violence should be prosecuted. "Everest is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts. This is true for professional and recreational climbers, and for Sherpa who earn most or all of their family\'s annual income in these two months on the mountain," guide Adrian Ballinger wrote. "The constant pressure to break records, attempt new routes, and be the strongest, whether for personal pride, sponsors, future job offers, or media, can cloud the purity of our climbing here. And these pressures can lead to disagreements, arguments, and hurt feelings. But none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence, or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other," Ballinger added.

S'DETROIT The friend of one of seven Americans killed in a cargo plane crash near an Air Force base in Afghanistan described him as an experienced navigator who performed well under pressure. First Officer Jamie Brokaw, of Monroe, was among six people from Michigan killed Monday, along with one person from Kentucky. Image of Boeing 747-400 seconds before it crashed after taking off from Bagram Air Base in Afgthanistan on April 29, 2013 "He was a very good person and very smart person," Chris Connerton told The Associated Press Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, Minn. Connerton credited Brokaw with helping get him through flight school, as well as a harrowing flight two years ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, Fla. Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that he could no longer get it to climb. "If it wasn\'t for Jamie\'s navigation and know-how ... we wouldn\'t have made it," Connerton said. "I don\'t know that I would have had the capacity to handle the situation on my own." Image of Boeing 747 seconds after its crash after taking off from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on April 29, 2013. 9 Photos Also killed in Monday\'s crash were pilots Brad Hasler of Trenton, Mich. and Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn, Mich.; First Officer Rinku Summan of Canton, Mich.; loadmaster Michael Sheets of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and maintenance crew Gary Stockdale of Romulus, Mich. and Timothy Garrett of Louisville, Ky. As loadmaster, Sheets was responsible for making sure the weight and balance of the cargo was appropriate. The Dubai-bound Boeing 747-400 was operated by National Air Cargo and crashed just after takeoff Monday from Bagram Air Base around 11:20 a.m. local time, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Tuesday. The video taken from YouTube appears to show the crash of the Boeing 747, even though the time stamp on the camera is off. The National Transportation Safety Board is studying the video for evidence about the crash. The accident site is within the perimeter of Bagram Air Base. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the plane, but NATO said later the claims were false, and there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time of the crash. The Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation is leading the investigation. The NTSB is investigating the crash alongside the ministry. The team will be composed of three NTSB investigators, as well as representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the NTSB said. National Air Cargo Vice President Shirley Kaufman said the plane \xe2\x80\x94 owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Florida-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 was carrying vehicles and other cargo. Connerton said he met Brokaw at a flight school in Jacksonville, Fla., and considered him one of his closest friends. Connerton described Brokaw as "the kind of guy everyone wanted to be." Image of Boeing 747 seconds after its crash after taking off from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on April 29, 2013 "He\'d do anything he can to help you," Connerton said. "I don\'t think I\'ve met one person in my life who doesn\'t like him." Bill Hasler said in a statement Tuesday that his family learned Monday morning that his brother, Brad, was one of the crash victims. "Brad was a wonderful father to two young children, a beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son, and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for," Bill Hasler said. "His influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable." National Airlines was based until recently at Michigan\'s Willow Run Airport, west of Detroit. It carries cargo both commercially and for the military, Kaufman said. She said the company employs about 225 people.'

S'A civilian cargo plane owned by an American company crashed at Bagram Air Field, north of the Afghan capital, soon after takeoff on Monday, killing all seven people aboard, the U.S.-led military coalition said. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the Boeing 747-400, but NATO said in a statement to The Associated Press that the Taliban "claims are false." The coalition says the cause of the crash was being investigated by emergency crews that rushed to the site, but there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time. Capt. Luca Carniel, a coalition spokesman, said the aircraft crashed from a low altitude right after takeoff. The plane \xe2\x80\x94 owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Florida-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 was carrying vehicles and other cargo, according to National Air Cargo Vice President Shirley Kaufman. She said those killed were four pilots, two mechanics and a load master, who was responsible for making sure that the weight and balance of the cargo is appropriate. Five of the seven fatalities were from Michigan, said Kaufman. "We are not yet releasing the identities of the colleagues we lost out of respect for their families who need a little more time to reach other loved ones," she said in an email to the AP. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority are investigating the crash, she said. National Airlines was based until recently at Michigan\'s Willow Run Airport, west of Detroit in Wayne County\'s Van Buren Township. It carries cargo both commercially and for the military, Kaufman said. She said it employs about 225 people. In another development, Afghan President Hamid Karzai accused U.S. forces of killing four civilians and wounding one in the eastern province of Nangarhar on Sunday after an American convoy was attacked by insurgents. In a statement issued by his office, Karzai "strongly condemned the killing of innocent civilians." The U.S.-led military coalition said it was still investigating the weekend clash, which left four soldiers with minor injuries and damaged a patrol vehicle. In a statement issued on Monday, the coalition said the Taliban attacked the coalition patrol with small arms fire and roadside bombs as it moved through a local bazaar in the province where there were civilians. "Coalition forces engaged the enemy, pushed through the hostile area, and traveled to a nearby Afghan National Army checkpoint," the coalition said in a statement. "An investigation is currently underway to assess whether there are any civilian casualties as a result of insurgent fire." \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Associated Press writers Amir Shah and Thomas Wagner in Kabul contributed to this report.'

S'DETROIT \xe2\x80\x94 Jamie Brokaw was an experienced navigator who was no stranger to dangerous flying situations and had the skills to stay cool in the face of danger, according to close friend Chris Connerton. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a very good person and very smart person,\xe2\x80\x9d Connerton told The Associated Press by telephone from Rochester, Minn. Brokaw, 33, of Monroe, Mich., was among seven Americans killed Monday when their National Air Cargo plane crashed near an Air Force base in Afghanistan. Six of the victims were from Michigan and a seventh was from Kentucky, said Shirley Kaufman, National Air Cargo vice president. Connerton said Brokaw was a key reason he was able to make it through flight school in Jacksonville, Fla., where they met. Connerton also described a harrowing flight two years ago from Toledo, Ohio, to an international flight expo in Lakeland, Fla. Connerton said ice had built up on the plane to the point that he could no longer get it to climb. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Jamie\xe2\x80\x99s navigation and know-how ... we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Connerton said. Killed along with Brokaw in the Afghanistan crash were maintenance worker Gary Stockdale, 51, of Romulus, Mich.; pilots Brad Hasler, 34, of Trenton, Mich., and Jeremy Lipka, 37, of Brooklyn, Mich.; first officer Rinku Summan, 32, of Canton, Mich.; loadmaster Michael Sheets, 36, of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and maintenance crewman Timothy Garrett, 51, of Louisville, Ky. Building model planes and working on real ones comprised Stockdale\xe2\x80\x99s passion, filling the family\xe2\x80\x99s basement with models in his youth, jumping into aviation as a career at age 16 \xe2\x80\x94 and later working at two Detroit-area airports. Stockdale also knew the dangers of flying, his older brother said Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always said it was dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Glenn Stockdale, 55. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would always say, \xe2\x80\x98You either will die in a car crash or a ball of flame in a plane.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Lipka had flow in Iraq as well as Afghanistan and had close calls before, said his stepfather, Dave Buttman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was risk there all the time. He knew the risks. He volunteered to take the trips,\xe2\x80\x9d Buttman told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. \xe2\x80\x9cBasically, you\xe2\x80\x99re taking your chances flying in there and he was just happy to be one of the pilots to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d The Dubai-bound Boeing 747-400 \xe2\x80\x94 operated by National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 crashed just after takeoff Monday from Bagram Air Base around 11:20 a.m. local time, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Tuesday. The accident site is within the perimeter of Bagram Air Base. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for downing the plane, but NATO said the claims were false and there was no sign of insurgent activity in the area at the time of the crash. The NTSB said it will lead a team of three investigators to assist the Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation in investigating the crash. But a ministry spokesman, Nangoialy Qalatwal, said Tuesday the ministry is not involved with the investigation because it occurred at a military and not a civilian airport. Kaufman said the plane \xe2\x80\x94 owned by National Airlines, an Orlando, Fla.-based subsidiary of National Air Cargo \xe2\x80\x94 was carrying vehicles and other cargo. Elena Garrett, of Jeffersonville, Ind., just across the Ohio River from Louisville, said ex-husband Timothy Garrett would have turned 52 on Saturday. They have two daughters together, ages 11 and 12. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all devastated,\xe2\x80\x9d Elena Garrett said about his death. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were still best friends.

S'A team of federal investigators and representatives from Boeing Co. are headed for Afghanistan to examine a cargo plane crash that took place Monday at U.S.-operated Bagram Air Base.\xc2\xa0 The cause of the accident is unknown, but the plane\xe2\x80\x99s operator, National Air Cargo, confirmed that all seven American civilian crew members were killed and the aircraft, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, was completely destroyed. "Safety is always our top priority at National Airlines," company President Glen Joerger said in a statement. "This is a devastating loss for our family and we\'ll work diligently with authorities to find the cause. Most importantly, our thoughts and prayers are with our crew members and their families." Coalition forces rely heavily on contracted aircraft to haul troops and supplies in a nation where roadside bombs and insurgent attacks make traveling by road dangerous. Bagram, just north of the country\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Kabul, is one of the two largest air bases serving coalition forces in Afghanistan. National Air Cargo said the 747 was filled with vehicles and other freight when it took off at 11:20 a.m. local time headed for Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International Airport, in the United Arab Emirates. Video footage of a crash surfaced on the Internet Tuesday, and depicted a jumbo jet taking off into overcast skies, before stalling, nose-diving and plummeting to the ground. The plane explodes upon impact and is engulfed in a massive fire ball. The video appears to be shot from a dashboard camera on a vehicle as it travels on a road toward an airport. The date on the dash cam is wrong, but was published within 24 hours of the crash. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed that officials have seen the video, but have not confirmed its origin or authenticity. Regardless, the NTSB confirmed it will lead a team to assist the Afghanistan Ministry of Transportation and Commercial Aviation in the crash investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing\xc2\xa0will also provide technical assistance to investigating authorities. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but the insurgent group often issues false claims. It was the second crash in three days involving coalition aircraft in Afghanistan. On Saturday, four U.S. airmen were killed when a military turboprop plane crashed in southern Afghanistan. Times staff writers David Zucchino and Hashmat Baktash in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.

S'MOJAVE, Calif. Virgin Galactic\'s SpaceShipTwo made its first powered flight Monday, breaking the sound barrier in a test over the Mojave Desert that moves the company closer to its goal of flying paying passengers on brief hops into space. "It couldn\'t have gone more smoothly," said Sir Richard Branson, who owns the spaceline with Aabar Investments PJC of Abu Dhabi. A special twin-fuselage jet carrying SpaceShipTwo took off at about 7:00 a.m. PDT, spent 45 minutes climbing to an altitude of 48,000 feet and released the spaceship. Pilot Mark Stucky and co-pilot Mike Alsbury then triggered SpaceShipTwo\'s rocket engine. The engine burned for 16 seconds, propelling the spaceship to an altitude of 55,000 feet and a velocity of Mach 1.2, surpassing the speed of sound. SpaceShipTwo then glided to a safe landing at Mojave Air and Space Port in the desert north of Los Angeles, said George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic\'s CEO. The 10-minute test flight was considered a major step for the program. "Having spaceship and rocket perform together in the air is a long way toward getting into space," said Branson, who watched from the ground. "A few more test flights with slightly bigger burns every time, and then we\'ll all be back here to watch it go into space." Play Video Until Monday, SpaceShipTwo had only performed unpowered glide flights. Several powered flights are planned this summer, culminating with a dash into space targeted toward the end of the year. SpaceShipTwo is a prototype commercial version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first privately developed manned rocket to reach space. Since the historic flight, more than 500 aspiring space tourists have paid $200,000 or plunked down deposits, patiently waiting for a chance to float in weightlessness and view the Earth\'s curvature from 62 miles up. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin in 2007, but a deadly explosion during ground testing and longer-than-expected test flights pushed the deadline back. No date has been set for the first commercial flight from a custom-designed spaceport in New Mexico, but Virgin Galactic executives have said it will come after testing is complete and it secures approval from the government. Branson previously said the maiden passenger flight will carry his family.

The trip marked the 26th test flight of the vehicle and the first "powered flight," which propelled the ship to Mach 1.2, fast enough to beat the speed of sound, which is 761 miles an hour.\xc2\xa0[ See amazing photos of SpaceShipTwo test flights ] "The rocket motor ignition went as planned, with the expected burn duration, good engine performance and solid vehicle handling qualities throughout," Virgin Galactic president and CEO George Whitesides said in a written statement. "The successful outcome of this test marks a pivotal point for our program. We will now embark on a handful of similar powered flight tests, and then make our first test flight to space." SpaceShipTwo is a suborbital vehicle, designed to carry space tourists on trips to the edge of space and back for $200,000 a ride. Though these flights wouldn\'t make a full orbit of the planet, they would provide passengers with a brief experience of weightlessness and a view of Earth from the blackness of space. Virgin Galactic is backed by British billionaire Richard Branson , who was on the ground at Mojave to view the flight Monday. "This is a momentous day and the single most important flight test to date for our Virgin Galactic program," Branson wrote in a blog post on Virgin\'s website. "What a feeling to be on the ground with all the team in Mojave to witness the occasion." If test flights continue to go well, SpaceShipTwo may carry passengers as soon as this year or 2014, Virgin Galactic officials have said. Already, more than 500 people have signed up for the flights, which will be run out of Spaceport America in New Mexico once testing is complete. The test flight began at 7 a.m. PT. Flying aboard SpaceShipTwo were pilot Mark Stucky and co-pilot Mike Alsbury, both test pilots for the private aerospace firm Scaled Composites, which built SpaceShipTwo for Virgin Galactic. It comes after two recent glide test flights, on April 3 and April 12, that set the stage for Monday\'s landmark powered test. Scaled also built the space plane\'s predecessor, SpaceShipOne, which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 by becoming the first commercial vehicle to fly people to space and back twice in a week.'

S'The space tourism firm Virgin Galactic has successfully test-fired the rocket motor designed to boost a passenger spaceliner on suborbital joy rides into space. The hybrid rocket motor would launch Virgin Galactic\'s SpaceShipTwo spacecraft into suborbital space at speeds of over 2,500 mph (4,000 kph) to send ticket-carrying passengers soaring to heights of 65 miles (110 km) above the Earth. This latest series of tests in the California desert follows flight tests for SpaceShipTwo\'s carrier aircraft WhiteKnightTwo, dubbed "Eve." The Eve mother ship ended up with a slight ding on its tail in April during what was then its longest test run yet. "SpaceShipTwo, which will air launch from Eve, is largely constructed and awaiting the start of its own test flight program later this year," said Sir Richard Branson, the British billionaire founder of Virgin Galactic. SpaceShipTwo is designed to carry eight people \xe2\x80\x94 six passengers and two pilots \xe2\x80\x94 into suborbital space and back for about $200,000 a ticket Unlike typical rockets, SpaceShipTwo would ride into the upper atmosphere under Eve\'s wing before igniting its own rocket engine to make the final ascent into space. That means the rocket motor only needs to burn for a short time period. "This means much less fuel is required \xe2\x80\x94 fuel which provides none of the toxins that are present in the solid rockets used by the space shuttle and satellite launches," Branson noted. He added that the spaceship\'s carbon footprint for each of its passengers and crew would be just a quarter of that for a return trip from London to New York. The hybrid nitrous oxide motor represents the largest of its kind in the world, designed by Virgin Galactic supplier Scaled Composites and its subcontractor SNC (Sierra Nevada Corporation). Safety features include the capability to shut down the system at any time, and permit the spaceship to glide back down for a conventional runway landing. Virgin Galactic has already lined up $40 million and 300 people on its waiting lists for space tourism flights. They\'ll have to keep waiting for now, as flight testing for SpaceShipTwo is scheduled for later this year.

S'British billionaire Richard Branson \xe2\x80\x99s commercial space venture Virgin Galactic got one step closer to carrying tourists into space when a test pilot cracked the sound barrier over the Mojave Desert. For the first time, the company\'s SpaceShipTwo engaged its rocket motor and sped to Mach 1.2 and reached 56,000 feet in altitude.

Quiz: How much do you know about the federal budget cuts? The test flight took place shortly after sunrise Monday beginning on the desert runway at Mojave Air and Space Port, about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. During the test, SpaceShipTwo was taken to about 46,000 feet by a carrier aircraft and dropped like a bomb. After a short free fall, test pilots Mark Stucky and Mike Alsbury engaged the hybrid rocket motor, powered by nitrous oxide and a rubber compound, for 16 seconds, at which point SpaceShipTwo reached Mach 1.2 speed. The idea of Virgin Galactic routinely taking passengers to space this way was developed by retired maverick aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and his Mojave company, Scaled Composites. Until now, astronauts have reached space packed tight in a capsule or shuttle attached to a high-powered rocket. Instead, Virgin Galactic will use a WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft that will fly with the reusable SpaceShipTwo rocket plane under its wing to 50,000 feet, where the spaceship will separate and blast off. When the rocket motor engages, it will power the spaceship to nearly 2,500 mph and take the pilot -\xe2\x80\x93 and up to six passengers -- to the edge of space, or more than 60 miles above the Earth\'s surface. Once they reach that suborbital altitude, passengers will experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. Then they will reenter the atmosphere and glide back to the runway. The price for the experience: $200,000. Virgin Galactic, founded by Branson, hopes to make its first passenger flight sometime next year from Spaceport America in New Mexico, where the company plans to conduct routine operations. The company said it has taken about 530 reservations for the ride. The WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft, which resembles a flying catamaran because it has two fuselages, and SpaceShipTwo are still in the midst of a test-flight program that will continue in the Mojave until Virgin Galactic believes it can begin commercial operations. Virgin Galactic\'s commercial space launch system is based on Rutan\'s SpaceShipOne, the world\'s first private manned spaceship, which successfully flew a test pilot to space and back three times during 2004 to win a $10 million X-Prize purse. The prize-winning spacecraft caught the eye of Branson, who wanted to work with Rutan on a much bigger rocket ship that could send not only a pilot into space but also fare-paying passengers. The enterprise was shrouded in secrecy for years. Then in 2007, during a test of the spaceship\'s propulsion system, an explosion killed three workers and injured three others. The blast exposed the secret project and reminded the public of the risks of rocketry. The project endured and Branson has since built a 68,000-square-foot facility at the space port for a joint venture, called Spaceship Co., to mass-produce its rocket ship and carrier aircraft. It was one of the first aircraft assembly plants to be built in the region in decades.

Some Americans have previously crossed the border without a visa, either knowingly or by mistake, but in this case, the official said, "This was somebody who was a tour operator who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North." The official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, says the State Department doesn\'t know the exact charges against Bae -- whom the North refers to by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho -- and is trying to clarify the matter through the Swedish Embassy. Media reports have listed the charges as plotting to overthrow the government, which carry penalties including death or life imprisonment. "In the past there have been many clear instances where American citizens are used as political bargaining chips, and our concern is that this individual not be used in this matter," the official added. North Korea plans to hold a trial against Bae, state media said Saturday, complicating tense relations between the North and the United States. Bae entered North Korea as a tourist on November 3, according to the Korean Central News Agency. According to the news agency, Bae confessed to an offense, but the KCNA did not say what it was.

S'The move comes amid a diplomatic standoff between North Korea and the United States, and as Pyongyang has threatened to attack U.S. military bases in the Pacific and the South. A number of U.S. citizens of Korean descent have run into trouble in North Korea over the years, and Pyongyang has tried to use their detention to extract visits by high-profile American figures, most notably former President Bill Clinton. In the latest case, Kenneth Bae, 44, has been held by police since arriving in the northeastern city of Rajin on November 3. He was among a group of five tourists. "In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it," KCNA state media reported, using North Korea\'s official title of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. "His crimes were proved by evidence," it said, adding he would soon be taken to the Supreme Court "to face judgment". It did not provide further details. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was aware of reports that an American citizen would face trial in North Korea. She said representatives of the Embassy of Sweden, which acts as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in North Korea, visited Bae on Friday. South Korean rights workers said that Pyongyang may have taken issue with some of his photographs, including those of homeless North Korean children. A South Korean newspaper published by an evangelical family said he may have been carrying footage of North Korea executing defectors and dissidents. It was impossible to verify this. According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is five to 10 years of hard labor. Clinton flew to Pyongyang in 2009 and met then-leader Kim Jong-il before securing the release of two American media workers who had been charged with entering the country illegally. Former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson, who has made numerous trips to North Korea, some to seek the release of detained Americans, said he hoped the trial might help lead to Bae\'s release. Richardson delivered a letter regarding Bae to officials during a trip to North Korea in January, although he was unable to meet him. "Hopefully the conclusion of the legal process for Kenneth Bae will set the stage for a release on humanitarian grounds," Richardson told Reuters in an email. But he said Bae "should not become a pawn in the current American-North Korean friction." Tensions between North Korea and South Korea and its ally the United States have spiraled in recent weeks since the United Nations tightened sanctions after North Korea\'s third nuclear weapon test in February. The toughening of those sanctions led to Pyongyang threatening nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States. North Korea has a long record of making threats to secure concessions from the United States and South Korea, only to repeat the process later. Both the United States and the South have said in recent days that the cycle must cease. On Friday, Pyongyang rejected a call for formal talks to end a standoff that forced operations at a joint industrial complex shared by the North and South to be halted. South Korea in turn said it would pull out all its remaining workers from the Kaesong factory complex, which is just inside North Korea and is one of the North\'s few sources of ready cash. Of the 175 remaining South Korean workers, 126 workers left the factory zone on Saturday. The rest are scheduled to return on Monday. A representative of the South Korean firms at the complex urged the government to hold inter-Korean talks and to authorize their visit to North Korea on Tuesday, South Korea\'s news agency Yonhap said.

S'SEOUL, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94 An American tour operator is facing indictment in North Korea on charges that he tried to overthrow the government there, the North\xe2\x80\x99s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday. The announcement about the tour operator, Kenneth Bae, an American born in South Korea, could complicate Washington\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program while avoiding confrontations that could lead to an armed conflict. Mr. Bae, from Washington State, traveled with a group of businessmen in November from Yanji, China, to the North Korean special economic zone of Rason, where he was arrested. The news report on Saturday said that the North had already finished its investigation and that Mr. Bae had admitted his guilt to charges that could draw the death penalty. South Korean human rights advocates have described Mr. Bae as a devout Christian who not only ran tours to North Korea, but was also interested in helping orphans in the Communist country. They said security officials in the North may have been offended by pictures of orphans that Mr. Bae had taken and stored in his computer. North Korea, a police state, has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington. Some were freed only after former American presidents traveled to the North. The North has been locked in a standoff with America and South Korea since it detonated a nuclear bomb in February. Some analysts say that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be chafing at his inability to shift the two countries from the tough stance they have taken, refusing to offer the North aid to relieve tensions. In January, Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, tried to see Mr. Bae during a private trip to the North, but he said he was rebuffed by the government. The Korean Central News Agency said that Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s crime had been \xe2\x80\x9cclearly substantiated by evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d The news agency did not say when Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s trial would begin. Under North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s criminal code, prosecutors are required to file a formal indictment within 10 days of the completion of an investigation. A court then rules on the case within 25 days. North Korea indicated on Saturday that Mr. Bae would not be allowed to appeal if convicted. In December, when North Korea officially confirmed Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s detention, it said he had been arrested on charges of committing \xe2\x80\x9chostile acts\xe2\x80\x9d against the North, a lesser crime than plotting to overthrow the government. In 2009, North Korea arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed \xe2\x80\x9chostile acts.\xe2\x80\x9d They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor, but were released five months later , after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North\xe2\x80\x99s capital, and met with Kim Jong-il, the leader at the time.

S'By Jane Chung SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday that a Korean-American tourist, jailed by the reclusive state since late last year, will face trial for "committing crimes" against the North. The move comes amid a diplomatic standoff between North Korea and the United States , and as Pyongyang has threatened to attack U.S. military bases in the Pacific and the South. A number of U.S. citizens of Korean descent have run into trouble in North Korea over the years, and Pyongyang has tried to use their detention to extract visits by high-profile American figures, most notably former President Bill Clinton. In the latest case, Kenneth Bae , 44, has been held by police since arriving in the northeastern city of Rajin on November 3. He was among a group of five tourists. "In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it," KCNA state media reported, using North Korea\'s official title of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. "His crimes were proved by evidence," it said, adding he would soon be taken to the Supreme Court "to face judgment". It did not provide further details. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was aware of reports that an American citizen would face trial in North Korea. She said representatives of the Embassy of Sweden, which acts as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in North Korea, visited Bae on Friday. South Korean rights workers said that Pyongyang may have taken issue with some of his photographs, including those of homeless North Korean children. A South Korean newspaper published by an evangelical family said he may have been carrying footage of North Korea executing defectors and dissidents. It was impossible to verify this. According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is five to 10 years of hard labor. Clinton flew to Pyongyang in 2009 and met then-leader Kim Jong-il before securing the release of two American media workers who had been charged with entering the country illegally. Former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson, who has made numerous trips to North Korea, some to seek the release of detained Americans, said he hoped the trial might help lead to Bae\'s release. Richardson delivered a letter regarding Bae to officials during a trip to North Korea in January, although he was unable to meet him. "Hopefully the conclusion of the legal process for Kenneth Bae will set the stage for a release on humanitarian grounds," Richardson told Reuters in an email. But he said Bae "should not become a pawn in the current American-North Korean friction." Tensions between North Korea and South Korea and its ally the United States have spiraled in recent weeks since the United Nations tightened sanctions after North Korea\'s third nuclear weapon test in February. The toughening of those sanctions led to Pyongyang threatening nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States. North Korea has a long record of making threats to secure concessions from the United States and South Korea, only to repeat the process later. Both the United States and the South have said in recent days that the cycle must cease. On Friday, Pyongyang rejected a call for formal talks to end a standoff that forced operations at a joint industrial complex shared by the North and South to be halted. South Korea in turn said it would pull out all its remaining workers from the Kaesong factory complex, which is just inside North Korea and is one of the North\'s few sources of ready cash. Of the 175 remaining South Korean workers, 126 workers left the factory zone on Saturday. The rest are scheduled to return on Monday. A representative of the South Korean firms at the complex urged the government to hold inter-Korean talks and to authorize their visit to North Korea on Tuesday, South Korea\'s news agency Yonhap said.

S'NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 With the simplest of sentences, NBA veteran Jason Collins set aside years of worry and silence to become the first active player in one of four major U.S. professional sports leagues to come out as gay. In a first-person article posted Monday on Sports Illustrated\'s website, Collins begins: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Collins has played for six teams in 12 seasons, most recently as a reserve with the Washington Wizards after a midseason trade from the Boston Celtics. He is now a free agent and wants to keep playing in the NBA. "I didn\'t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I\'m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different,"\' Collins writes. "If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand." Saying he had "endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie," Collins immediately drew support for his announcement from the White House -- President Barack Obama called him -- along with former President Bill Clinton, the NBA, current and former teammates, a sponsor, and athletes in other sports. Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant tweeted that he was proud of Collins, writing: "Don\'t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others," followed by the words "courage" and "support." "We\'ve got to get rid of the shame. That\'s the main thing. And Jason\'s going to help that. He\'s going to help give people courage to come out," said Billie Jean King, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who confirmed she was gay after being outed in the early 1980s. "I guarantee you he\'s going to feel much lighter, much freer. The truth does set you free, there\'s no question. It doesn\'t mean it\'s easy. But it sets you free," King said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. The Wizards, whose season ended April 17, issued a statement from President Ernie Grunfeld: "We are extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly. He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientation." Collins\' coach with the Celtics, Doc Rivers, drew a comparison between Monday\'s announcement and Jackie Robinson\'s role when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball. "I am extremely happy and proud of Jason Collins. He\'s a pro\'s pro. He is the consummate professional and he is one of my favorite `team\' players I have ever coached," Rivers said. "If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept. It will be society who has to learn tolerance." Collins says he quietly made a statement for gay rights even while keeping his sexual orientation a secret. He wore No. 98 with the Celtics and Wizards -- 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, was killed, and the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization, was founded. According to the General Social Survey, the public has grown increasingly accepting of gay relationships since the late 1980s. That survey found in 1987 that 76 percent of Americans thought sexual relations between adults of the same sex was morally wrong. That fell to 43 percent by 2012. "I\'m glad I\'m coming out in 2013 rather than 2003. The climate has shifted; public opinion has shifted," Collins writes. "And yet we still have so much farther to go. Everyone is terrified of the unknown, but most of us don\'t want to return to a time when minorities were openly discriminated against." While some gay athletes have talked in the past about concerns that coming out would hurt their earning potential, 12-time Grand Slam singles champion King said she thinks Collins\' openness could have the opposite effect. "I have a feeling he\'s got a whole new career," King said. "I have a feeling he\'s going to make more in endorsements than he\'s ever made in his life." Sports equipment maker Nike released a statement Monday saying: "We admire Jason\'s courage and are proud that he is a Nike athlete. Nike believes in a level playing field where an athlete\'s sexual orientation is not a consideration." On Monday evening, hours after his story appeared on the web, Collins wrote on Twitter: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone." Momentum has been building toward this sort of announcement from a pro athlete in a top league in the United States. NFL players Brendan Ayanbadejo and Chris Kluwe were outspoken in support of state gay-marriage amendments during last year\'s elections. Obama spoke about his support for gay marriage during his re-election campaign. The topic made waves during Super Bowl week when one player, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver, said he wouldn\'t welcome a gay member of his team. At the time, Ayanbadejo estimated that at least half of the NFL\'s players would agree with what Culliver said, at least privately. Scott Fujita, who recently retired after an 11-year NFL career, said: "I\'m pleased to see such an overwhelmingly positive reaction to this news, because it just shows that we\'re becoming more accepting every day. But more than anything else, I\'m happy for Jason. I\'m not a gay, closeted athlete, so I can\'t pretend to know what that must have felt like for him. But I imagine this is freeing for him, and hopefully he\'s encouraged by the millions of people who are voicing their support. ... It\'s not a reaction to some rumor and it\'s not some unwanted outing. It\'s his message, and it was delivered under his control and on his terms." On Monday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams reiterating the league\'s anti-discrimination policy about sexuality. It includes a section on questions teams cannot ask prospective draft picks and free agents. After the NFL combine in February, three players said officials posed questions about sexual orientation. Earlier this month, the NHL and its players\' union partnered with an advocacy organization fighting homophobia in sports, and Commissioner Gary Bettman said the You Can Play Project underlines that "the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands." "I would say the NHL has been a force to kind of obviously embrace and encourage. ... What (Collins) did, I think it\'s definitely (good) for basketball, and the same for hockey, too. It\'s going to be encouraging for more guys to step up and just be open about themselves," Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward said. Living in the nation\'s capital last month while the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about same-sex marriage had an effect on Collins, who says "the strain of hiding my sexuality became almost unbearable" at that time. "Less than three miles from my apartment, nine jurists argued about my happiness and my future. Here was my chance to be heard, and I couldn\'t say a thing," he writes. "I didn\'t want to answer questions and draw attention to myself." After being a first-round draft pick in 2001, Collins has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds for the New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Celtics and Wizards. In his SI piece, he jokes self-effacingly about his journeyman career and a parlor game known as "Three Degrees of Jason Collins." "If you\'re in the league, and I haven\'t been your teammate, I surely have been one of your teammates\' teammates. Or one of your teammates\' teammates\' teammates," he writes. Never a star, he acknowledges, "I take charges and I foul -- that\'s been my forte. ... I set picks with my 7-foot, 255-pound body to get guys like Jason Kidd, John Wall and Paul Pierce open. I sacrifice myself for other players." He continues: "I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: That guy is gay? But I\'ve always been an aggressive player, even in high school. Am I so physical to prove that being gay doesn\'t make you soft? Who knows? That\'s something for a psychologist to unravel." As for what response other NBA players will have to his revelation, Collins writes: "The simple answer is, I have no idea." "Openness may not completely disarm prejudice, but it\'s a good place to start. It all comes down to education. I\'ll sit down with any player who\'s uneasy about my coming out," he says in his account, adding: "Still, if I\'m up against an intolerant player, I\'ll set a pretty hard pick on him. And then move on." On Monday, there was an outpouring of positive sentiments. In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out. He was a great teammate," and rookie Bradley Beal said: "I didn\'t know about it! I don\'t think anyone did! I am proud of his decision to come out and express the way he feels and I\'m supportive of that!!" Former teammate Jerry Stackhouse, now with the Brooklyn Nets, wrote in a text: "I hope Jason is received well by our NBA family. Jason is a friend and a former teammate that I\'ve enjoyed many laughs and conversations with and his sexual orientation won\'t change that with me. I\'ve already reached out to him personally to show support and will encourage more guys to do the same." NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement: "Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue." While Collins is the first male athlete in a major North American professional league to come out while intending to keep playing, several have previously spoken after they retired about being gay, including the NBA\'s John Amaechi, the NFL\'s Esera Tuaolo and Major League Baseball\'s Billy Bean. "I think he is immensely brave. I think it\'s a shame in this day and age he has to be immensely brave, but he is," Amaechi told the AP. "He\'s going to be a remarkable and eloquent spokesperson for what it is to be a decent, authentic human being -- never mind just for gay people." Rick Welts, president and chief operating officer of the NBA\'s Golden State Warriors, is openly gay. "He probably knows what he signed up for. There\'ll be a whole bunch more television reporters and cameras than he\'s probably had in the past. ... There had been a long of speculation about when, who, how. I think that speculation has been put to rest now," Welts said, "and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first man to do this." Collins says that if he remains in the NBA, he could face uncomfortable reactions from spectators. "I don\'t mind if they heckle me. I\'ve been booed before. There have been times when I\'ve wanted to boo myself. But a lot of ill feelings can be cured by winning," he writes. He adds: "I hope fans will respect me for raising my hand. And I hope teammates will remember that I\'ve never been an in-your-face kind of guy. All you need to know is that I\'m single. I see no need to delve into specifics." In February, former U.S. soccer national team player Robbie Rogers said he was gay -- and retired at the same time. Rogers is just 25, and others have urged him to resume his career. "I feel a movement coming," he tweeted after word of Collins\' news broke. Female athletes have found more acceptance in coming out; Brittney Griner, a top college basketball player now headed to the WNBA, caused few ripples when she said this month she is a lesbian. Tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out decades ago, tweeted Monday that Collins is "a brave man." "1981 was the year for me -- 2013 is the year for you," her post added. Sports leagues in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been trying to combat anti-gay bias. But the taboo remains particularly strong in soccer, where there are no openly gay players in Europe\'s top leagues. Homophobic chants are still heard at some games. Soccer "is not going to change," said Amaechi, who is English and now lives in Manchester. "If it wanted to change, it would change. It has the resources to do so. It doesn\'t want to change." Justin Fashanu is the only significant British soccer player to have come out publicly, doing so in 1990. The former Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker was found hanged in a London garage in 1998 at age 37. According to an inquest, Fashanu left a note saying that, because he was gay, he feared he wouldn\'t get a fair trial in the United States on sexual assault charges. Maryland police were seeking him on charges that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old boy. Among other athletes outside the U.S. to come out was Gareth Thomas, a Welsh rugby star who attracted widespread media attention in 2009 when he announced he was gay. He continued playing until retirement in 2011. Orlando Cruz of Puerto Rico came out in October as the first openly gay professional male boxer. Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury came out six years after winning a gold medal in the backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Four-time Olympic diving gold medalist Greg Louganis of the U.S. revealed he was gay in 1994, a year before announcing he was also HIV-positive. Former Olympic skiing gold medalist Anja Paerson of Sweden announced last year, after retiring, that she was in a long-term relationship with a woman. White House spokesman Jay Carney called Collins\' decision courageous and said the administration views it as another example of progress and evolution in the U.S. as Americans grow more accepting of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Former President Clinton said: "Jason\'s announcement today is an important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community. It is also the straightforward statement of a good man who wants no more than what so many of us seek: to be able to be who we are; to do our work; to build families and to contribute to our communities. For so many members of the LGBT community, these simple goals remain elusive." Collins attended Stanford with Clinton\'s daughter Chelsea and played in a Final Four while at the school. His twin brother, Jarron, was also a longtime NBA center who last played in the league in the 2010-11 season. Collins says he told his brother he was gay last summer. "He was downright astounded. He never suspected. So much for twin telepathy," Collins writes in SI. "But by dinner that night, he was full of brotherly love. For the first time in our lives, he wanted to step in and protect me." Advocacy organization GLAAD released a statement from Aaron McQuade, the head of its sports program. "Courage\' and `inspiration\' are words that get thrown around a lot in sports, but Jason Collins has given both ideas a brand new context," he said. "We hope that his future team will welcome him, and that fans of the NBA and sports in general will applaud him. We know that the NBA will proudly support him, and that countless young LGBT athletes now have a new hero." At Stanford, Collins was a college roommate of Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. In his account, Collins writes that he realized he needed to go public when the congressman walked in Boston\'s gay pride parade last year -- and Collins decided he couldn\'t join him. "For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find. Without question or hesitation, he gives everything he\'s got to those of us lucky enough to be in his life. I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend," Kennedy said in a statement. In Monday\'s story, Collins writes that the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city\'s 2013 gay rights parade. "Some people insist they\'ve never met a gay person. But Three Degrees of Jason Collins dictates that no NBA player can claim that anymore. Pro basketball is a family. And pretty much every family I know has a brother, sister or cousin who\'s gay," Collins concludes. "In the brotherhood of the NBA, I just happen to be the one who\'s out."'

aS"On Monday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams reiterating the league's anti-discrimination policy about sexuality. It includes a section on questions teams cannot ask prospective draft picks and free agents. After the NFL combine in February, three players said officials posed questions about sexual orientation."
p3309
aS'Earlier this month, the NHL and its players\' union partnered with an advocacy organization fighting homophobia in sports, and Commissioner Gary Bettman said the You Can Play Project underlines that "the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands."'
p3310
aS'"I would say the NHL has been a force to kind of obviously embrace and encourage. ... What (Collins) did, I think it\'s definitely (good) for basketball, and the same for hockey, too. It\'s going to be encouraging for more guys to step up and just be open about themselves," Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward said.'
p3311
aS'Living in the nation\'s capital last month while the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about same-sex marriage had an effect on Collins, who says "the strain of hiding my sexuality became almost unbearable" at that time.'
p3312
aS'"Less than three miles from my apartment, nine jurists argued about my happiness and my future. Here was my chance to be heard, and I couldn\'t say a thing," he writes. "I didn\'t want to answer questions and draw attention to myself."'
p3313
aS'After being a first-round draft pick in 2001, Collins has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds for the New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Celtics and Wizards.'
p3314
aS'In his SI piece, he jokes self-effacingly about his journeyman career and a parlor game known as "Three Degrees of Jason Collins."'
p3315
aS'"If you\'re in the league, and I haven\'t been your teammate, I surely have been one of your teammates\' teammates. Or one of your teammates\' teammates\' teammates," he writes.'
p3316
aS'Never a star, he acknowledges, "I take charges and I foul -- that\'s been my forte. ... I set picks with my 7-foot, 255-pound body to get guys like Jason Kidd, John Wall and Paul Pierce open. I sacrifice myself for other players."'
p3317
aS'He continues: "I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: That guy is gay? But I\'ve always been an aggressive player, even in high school. Am I so physical to prove that being gay doesn\'t make you soft? Who knows? That\'s something for a psychologist to unravel."'
p3318
aS'As for what response other NBA players will have to his revelation, Collins writes: "The simple answer is, I have no idea."'
p3319
aS'"Openness may not completely disarm prejudice, but it\'s a good place to start. It all comes down to education. I\'ll sit down with any player who\'s uneasy about my coming out," he says in his account, adding: "Still, if I\'m up against an intolerant player, I\'ll set a pretty hard pick on him. And then move on."'
p3320
aS'On Monday, there was an outpouring of positive sentiments.'
p3321
aS'In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out. He was a great teammate," and rookie Bradley Beal said: "I didn\'t know about it! I don\'t think anyone did! I am proud of his decision to come out and express the way he feels and I\'m supportive of that!!"'
p3322
aS'Former teammate Jerry Stackhouse, now with the Brooklyn Nets, wrote in a text: "I hope Jason is received well by our NBA family. Jason is a friend and a former teammate that I\'ve enjoyed many laughs and conversations with and his sexual orientation won\'t change that with me. I\'ve already reached out to him personally to show support and will encourage more guys to do the same."'
p3323
aS'NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement: "Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue."'
p3324
aS"While Collins is the first male athlete in a major North American professional league to come out while intending to keep playing, several have previously spoken after they retired about being gay, including the NBA's John Amaechi, the NFL's Esera Tuaolo and Major League Baseball's Billy Bean."
p3325
aS'"I think he is immensely brave. I think it\'s a shame in this day and age he has to be immensely brave, but he is," Amaechi told the AP. "He\'s going to be a remarkable and eloquent spokesperson for what it is to be a decent, authentic human being -- never mind just for gay people."'
p3326
aS"Rick Welts, president and chief operating officer of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, is openly gay."
p3327
aS'"He probably knows what he signed up for. There\'ll be a whole bunch more television reporters and cameras than he\'s probably had in the past. ... There had been a long of speculation about when, who, how. I think that speculation has been put to rest now," Welts said, "and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first man to do this."'
p3328
aS'Collins says that if he remains in the NBA, he could face uncomfortable reactions from spectators.'
p3329
aS'"I don\'t mind if they heckle me. I\'ve been booed before. There have been times when I\'ve wanted to boo myself. But a lot of ill feelings can be cured by winning," he writes.'
p3330
aS'He adds: "I hope fans will respect me for raising my hand. And I hope teammates will remember that I\'ve never been an in-your-face kind of guy. All you need to know is that I\'m single. I see no need to delve into specifics."'
p3331
aS'In February, former U.S. soccer national team player Robbie Rogers said he was gay -- and retired at the same time. Rogers is just 25, and others have urged him to resume his career.'
p3332
aS'"I feel a movement coming," he tweeted after word of Collins\' news broke.'
p3333
aS'Female athletes have found more acceptance in coming out; Brittney Griner, a top college basketball player now headed to the WNBA, caused few ripples when she said this month she is a lesbian. Tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out decades ago, tweeted Monday that Collins is "a brave man."'
p3334
aS'"1981 was the year for me -- 2013 is the year for you," her post added.'
p3335
aS"Sports leagues in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been trying to combat anti-gay bias. But the taboo remains particularly strong in soccer, where there are no openly gay players in Europe's top leagues. Homophobic chants are still heard at some games."
p3336
aS'Soccer "is not going to change," said Amaechi, who is English and now lives in Manchester. "If it wanted to change, it would change. It has the resources to do so. It doesn\'t want to change."'
p3337
aS"Justin Fashanu is the only significant British soccer player to have come out publicly, doing so in 1990. The former Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker was found hanged in a London garage in 1998 at age 37. According to an inquest, Fashanu left a note saying that, because he was gay, he feared he wouldn't get a fair trial in the United States on sexual assault charges. Maryland police were seeking him on charges that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old boy."
p3338
aS'Among other athletes outside the U.S. to come out was Gareth Thomas, a Welsh rugby star who attracted widespread media attention in 2009 when he announced he was gay. He continued playing until retirement in 2011.'
p3339
aS'Orlando Cruz of Puerto Rico came out in October as the first openly gay professional male boxer. Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury came out six years after winning a gold medal in the backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Four-time Olympic diving gold medalist Greg Louganis of the U.S. revealed he was gay in 1994, a year before announcing he was also HIV-positive. Former Olympic skiing gold medalist Anja Paerson of Sweden announced last year, after retiring, that she was in a long-term relationship with a woman.'
p3340
aS"White House spokesman Jay Carney called Collins' decision courageous and said the administration views it as another example of progress and evolution in the U.S. as Americans grow more accepting of gay rights and same-sex marriage."
p3341
aS'Former President Clinton said: "Jason\'s announcement today is an important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community. It is also the straightforward statement of a good man who wants no more than what so many of us seek: to be able to be who we are; to do our work; to build families and to contribute to our communities. For so many members of the LGBT community, these simple goals remain elusive."'
p3342
aS"Collins attended Stanford with Clinton's daughter Chelsea and played in a Final Four while at the school. His twin brother, Jarron, was also a longtime NBA center who last played in the league in the 2010-11 season. Collins says he told his brother he was gay last summer."
p3343
aS'"He was downright astounded. He never suspected. So much for twin telepathy," Collins writes in SI. "But by dinner that night, he was full of brotherly love. For the first time in our lives, he wanted to step in and protect me."'
p3344
aS'Advocacy organization GLAAD released a statement from Aaron McQuade, the head of its sports program.'
p3345
aS'"Courage\' and `inspiration\' are words that get thrown around a lot in sports, but Jason Collins has given both ideas a brand new context," he said. "We hope that his future team will welcome him, and that fans of the NBA and sports in general will applaud him. We know that the NBA will proudly support him, and that countless young LGBT athletes now have a new hero."'
p3346
aS"At Stanford, Collins was a college roommate of Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. In his account, Collins writes that he realized he needed to go public when the congressman walked in Boston's gay pride parade last year -- and Collins decided he couldn't join him."
p3347
aS'"For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find. Without question or hesitation, he gives everything he\'s got to those of us lucky enough to be in his life. I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend," Kennedy said in a statement.'
p3348
aS'In Monday\'s story, Collins writes that the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?"'
p3349
aS"And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city's 2013 gay rights parade."
p3350
aS'"Some people insist they\'ve never met a gay person. But Three Degrees of Jason Collins dictates that no NBA player can claim that anymore. Pro basketball is a family. And pretty much every family I know has a brother, sister or cousin who\'s gay," Collins concludes. "In the brotherhood of the NBA, I just happen to be the one who\'s out."'

S'When Mark Madsen got a text message from Jason Collins early Monday morning asking him to call, Madsen thought the two were going to discuss graduate school options. Madsen just completed his MBA at Stanford, where both he and Collins played basketball as undergrads, and Madsen knows Collins is interested in graduate school. "He said, \'I\'m actually coming out. I\'m gay,\' " Madsen told USA TODAY Sports. "I said, \'Jason, thanks for letting me know. I got your back.\' " The two talked privately for a few minutes, Madsen said, before Collins began calling others in advance of a first-person Sports Illustrated story hitting the web. FREE AGENCY: Collins\' immediate NBA future POSITIVE REACTION: Kobe, Clinton offer support Collins will be a free agent this summer . Where he\'ll play next season, if he does, is one of many questions about the first openly gay male athlete in North American team sports while still an active player. Here are some others: Q: Why is Collins a good fit for this role? Cyd Zeigler, a manager of OutSports.com, a leading website on gay sports, has covered this issue for years. "We\'ve talked about who this person could be in the past. And Jason kind of fits the mold. A really good player who\'s been in the league for a long time who doesn\'t have a lot to lose in endorsement deals. He is set for the rest of his life financially. I never thought it was going to be a superstar." Q: Why is the timing right? Zeigler has written before that the best time for an athlete to make such an announcement would be early in an offseason. Collins\' timing "just two weeks after his regular season ended, and six months before the season starts, it couldn\'t be a better time to do this. The media will get the story out of its system before tip-off of the next season." BACKLASH: ESPN reporter calls Collins a sinner BRENNAN: Just call Jason Collins a team player Q: Are pro team sports ready to accept gay athletes in their locker rooms? Madsen said he thinks NBA locker rooms are ready: "Do you respect others, how do you treat others and how do you play? Those are the rules of the locker room.

VIDEO: WIZARDS OFFER STATEMENT OF SUPPORT NBA player Jason Collins came out as the first openly gay professional athlete. His team, the Washington Wizards, made a statement supporting Collins. Q: How did Collins make his announcement? Collins started his piece in SI , written with Franz Lidz, by writing: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Other excerpts: "I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different.\' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand. ... When I was younger I dated women. I even got engaged. I thought I had to live a certain way. I thought I needed to marry a woman and raise kids with her. I kept telling myself the sky was red, but I always knew it was blue." Later Monday, Collins tweeted: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone" "Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me thru email, texts, calls, tweets, letters, and every other form of communication #support."

I\'ll love him and I\'ll support him and, if necessary, I\'ll protect him." Q: Exactly what was it that ESPN\'s NBA insider Chris Broussard said on his network\'s Outside the Lines show? "Personally I don\'t believe that you can live an openly homosexual lifestyle or ... openly (engage in) premarital sex between heterosexuals. If you\'re openly living that type of lifestyle, the Bible says you know them by their fruits, it says that\'s a sin. If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ." OPEN: How leagues have prepared for a gay athlete NOTEWORTHY: Five key quotes from Collins interview Q: Charles Barkley also weighed in, on NBA TV. What did he say? "We\'ve all played with gay guys. We didn\'t treat them bad. ... For us to have an honest discussion, if guys don\'t like it, they should be able to say it and not get crucified." Q: Longtime NBA executive Rick Welts, who is now the president of the Golden State Warriors, disclosed publicly that he is gay two years ago. What was his take on Monday\'s news? "This is such a personal thing to reach the point in your life where you\'re prepared to do this. I\'m very proud of him. It\'s a very, very courageous thing that he chose to do. I read the story. It came through that it was very authentic. ... He\'s somebody who didn\'t have the benefit of somebody going before him in the same situation to learn, to watch, to see how people would react. It takes a man of great courage to do what he did today. I\'m happy for him. He\'s going to be able to be the complete Jason Collins every day for the rest of his life. "I think he probably knows what he signed up for. He\'s going to face a whole bunch more television cameras and reporters than he probably has over the course of the last couple seasons. But clearly, it\'s somebody who\'s given this a lot of thought. He\'s prepared for it and it\'s what he signed up for. There\'s been a lot of speculation about when, who, how (an athlete from any of the major sports would come out). And that speculation\'s been put to rest now and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first player to do this." PHOTOS: WHO IS JASON COLLINS? Q: Will Monday\'s news help or hurt Collins as a free agent? "I don\'t think it will hurt him," Zeigler said. "There are very few front office executives who will look at somebody and say, \'He could help us, but because he\'s gay we don\'t want him.\' There will be some executives who see a marketing opportunity." Veteran NBA executive Ed Stefanski was part of the then-New Jersey Nets front-office staff that drafted Jason Collins No. 18 in the first round in 2001. "His basketball IQ was off the chart," Stefanski said, adding he would be "very disappointed" if Collins\' announcement hurt his chances. "He has done a good job getting his weight down," Stefanski said. "But can he be athletic enough? He\'s smart enough. But can he be a third center for a team? ... A young team can use a player like him in the locker room, and a real good team can use him in spots to give guys a breather and know the team isn\'t going to fall apart when he\'s on the court." Welts is not involved in player personnel decisions, but said: "If he can convince a coach and general manager that he can play and help their team, he\'ll have another job. ... It\'ll all be what he can do on the court." Q: At what point will announcements like Monday\'s no longer be news? Zeigler: "I don\'t know at what point, whether it\'s No. 7 or 12 or 18, when the media has had enough of this story. We\'re not there yet. Gay people can\'t get married. I can\'t marry my partner of 10 years. When we have equal rights, and we\'re out and proud in every aspect of life, then I think we\'ll see that. But until then, it\'s still an issue." Q: So what\'s the big picture takeaway? "We\'re lagging behind where our society is on this issue," Welts said of men\'s pro team sports. "To some degree, we caught up a little bit today."'

S'WASHINGTON -- \n  Last summer, NBA veteran Jason Collins considered joining an old Stanford college roommate, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, at Boston\'s gay pride parade. Collins eventually decided he shouldn\'t, because he wanted to keep his secret safe: For more than a decade as a professional athlete, he had remained silent about his sexuality, worried about what teammates, opponents, fans - the world, really - might think. Then came the Boston Marathon bombings two weeks ago, which Collins says "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" So after having, he explains, "endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie," Collins became the first active player in one of the four major U.S. pro sports leagues to come out as gay. He wrote a first-person article posted Monday on Sports Illustrated\'s website that begins: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Most recently a little-used reserve center for the Washington Wizards after a midseason trade from the Boston Celtics, the 7-foot Collins is a free agent who can sign with any team. He wants to keep playing in the NBA. And he plans to be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city\'s 2013 gay pride parade. "I didn\'t doubt for a second, knowing he was gay, that he would be the one to do it," Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, told The Associated Press. "I\'ve never known him to look for publicity, or to look for the spotlight, but given that no one else would raise their hand, I knew he would do it." Added Kennedy: "I\'m so proud of him. And I\'m so proud to call him a friend." In an interview taped Monday and aired Tuesday morning, Collins told ABC\'s "Good Morning America": "I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player." His announcement Monday, nearly two weeks after the Wizards\' season ended, immediately drew praise and backing not only from pals, current and former teammates and coaches, the NBA itself, and a sponsor, but also from the White House. President Barack Obama called him - "he was incredibly supportive and he was proud of me," Collins told ABC - along with former President Bill Clinton, and athletes in various other sports. "I certainly appreciate it, as a gay person. Any time you can have someone this high-profile come out, it\'s just so helpful, particularly to young people. We\'ve reached a tipping point," said Billie Jean King, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who won 12 Grand Slam singles titles. "We\'ve got to get rid of the shame. That\'s the main thing," King said in a telephone interview. "And Jason\'s going to help that. He\'s going to help give people courage to come out." In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out. He was a great teammate," and rookie Bradley Beal wrote: "I didn\'t know about it! I don\'t think anyone did! I am proud of his decision to come out and express the way he feels and I\'m supportive of that!!" Collins\' coach with the Celtics, Doc Rivers, drew a comparison between Monday\'s announcement and Jackie Robinson\'s role when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball.'

S'In 12 seasons as an N.B.A. player, Jason Collins has never been an All-Star or a scoring leader or even a full-time starter, but on Monday he shattered one of the last great barriers in professional sports. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a 34-year-old N.B.A. center. I\xe2\x80\x99m black and I\xe2\x80\x99m gay,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins, who finished this season with the Washington Wizards, writes in the May 6 edition of Sports Illustrated . The magazine published the article online Monday morning. With that statement, Collins became the first openly gay male athlete who is still active in a major American team sport. Other gay athletes, including the former N.B.A. center John Amaechi, have waited until retirement to divulge their sexuality publicly. The announcement followed recent decisions by two other athletes \xe2\x80\x94 the American soccer player Robbie Rogers and the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball player Brittney Griner \xe2\x80\x94 to acknowledge that they are gay. When Rogers, 25, revealed last month that he was gay, he also said he was retiring from soccer. (He has since indicated he may play again.) Griner, the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, will soon embark on her professional career. Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was greeted with an outpouring of support from teammates, league executives and major National Basketball Association stars, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade among them. \xe2\x80\x9cProud of @jasoncollins34,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant, the Los Angeles Lakers star, wrote on his Twitter account. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others.\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant added two hashtags: \xe2\x80\x9ccourage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csupport.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of the league\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names followed suit, including the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 Steve Nash, Oklahoma City\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Durant, the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 Jason Kidd and San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Parker. Several teams sent out statements of support. Prominent coaches, including Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Doc Rivers, who has worked with Collins, gave support in interviews. However, one National Football League player, Mike Wallace of the Miami Dolphins, posted a comment on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cAll these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys.\xe2\x80\x9d He later deleted the comment and issued an apology. And on ESPN, the N.B.A. analyst Chris Broussard, citing his religious beliefs, said that living openly as a homosexual was a sin and that doing so was \xe2\x80\x9cwalking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d But those comments were greatly outweighed by the supportive ones Collins received, particularly from his N.B.A. peers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe overwhelming positive reaction does not surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cOur players are actually knowledgeable and sophisticated on this issue, and our teams understand it completely. I would have expected them to be supportive, and they are.\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama called Collins \xe2\x80\x9cto express his support and said he was impressed by his courage,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a Twitter post from the White House. Michelle Obama, on her account, called Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement \xe2\x80\x9ca huge step forward for our country.\xe2\x80\x9d Collins becomes a free agent July 1 and intends to pursue another contract, which might be viewed as a truer test for how N.B.A. teams deal with a gay athlete. However, complicating that question is the fact that Collins, at 34, is a marginal player with limited skills, more valued for his locker-room presence than his play and not at the top of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s list of players to sign. He appeared in just 38 games this season, which he split between the Boston Celtics and the Wizards, and was used sparingly. Collins was never among the most skilled centers to begin with, instead relying on his size (7 feet, 255 pounds), intelligence and work ethic to carve out a niche after being drafted 18th over all in 2001. In his Sports Illustrated essay, Collins alludes to his future in the league: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve reached that enviable state in life in which I can do pretty much what I want. And what I want is to continue to play basketball. I still love the game, and I still have something to offer. My coaches and teammates recognize that. At the same time, I want to be genuine and authentic and truthful.\xe2\x80\x9d One N.B.A. scout estimated that Collins had a 25 percent chance of making an opening-night roster next season, based solely on his basketball skills. But a general manager for another team predicted that Collins would be back in the league because of his reputation as a solid teammate and leader. That general manager said that Collins\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of his sexuality could even appeal to a forward-thinking owner. Dave Kopay, who came out as gay in 1975 after a nine-year N.F.L. career, said on Monday he had waited nearly 40 years for this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he did is not easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kopay said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m overwhelmed with how he\xe2\x80\x99s done this. I\xe2\x80\x99m so, so happy right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi, who announced that he was gay after a five-year N.B.A. career, called Collins\xe2\x80\x99s public declaration \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly groundbreaking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe are unusually blessed to have such an eloquent spokesman,\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi said in a phone interview from England, where he lives. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say \xe2\x80\x98we,\xe2\x80\x99 I mean society, as opposed to just gay people. Anybody who has ever interviewed Jason knows he is not just your average athlete. He\xe2\x80\x99s cerebral, thoughtful, kind \xe2\x80\x94 so many things that many athletes are not enough of. Add this authentic declaration on top of things, it makes him one of the perfect role models for our young people.\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi was among several gay-rights advocates who said it mattered whether Collins played next season. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s not on a team, he\xe2\x80\x99s just another guy who did it at the end of his career, and he retired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim Buzinski, a co-founder of Outsports, a Web site devoted to gays and sports. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil we see him walking onto a court, in either a starting lineup or in a backup role off the bench, and there\xe2\x80\x99s that anticipation that Jason Collins is going to step on the floor \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to matter as much until that moment. That\xe2\x80\x99s what everyone is waiting for.\xe2\x80\x9d Until now, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s only public hint of his orientation was a subtle one. He wore No. 98 for the Celtics and the Wizards, in honor of Matthew Shepard, the gay University of Wyoming student who was killed in 1998. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number has great significance to the gay community,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins wrote. Collins informed his Wizards teammates, as well as Stern, in a series of phone calls Monday morning, before the story was published online. One Wizards teammate, Emeka Okafor, said that if Collins returned to Washington, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome him back with open arms.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s still the same guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Okafor said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just let us know more about him.\xe2\x80\x9d Collins grew up in the Los Angeles suburbs and played college basketball at Stanford. As a professional, Collins has averaged a modest 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds a game while playing for six teams. He spent most of his first seven seasons with the Nets, helping them reach the finals in 2002 and 2003. But Collins kept his sexuality deeply hidden. In an accompanying essay in Sports Illustrated, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s twin brother, Jarron \xe2\x80\x94 a former N.B.A. center who now scouts for the Los Angeles Clippers \xe2\x80\x94 wrote that he \xe2\x80\x9chad no idea\xe2\x80\x9d that Jason was gay until Jason told him last summer. Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement also surprised his closest friends, including Mark Madsen, who played three years with Collins at Stanford and another season in the N.B.A., with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Madsen was among the people Collins called Monday morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say one of Jason\xe2\x80\x99s amazing characteristics is he has always been unafraid to express his opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d Madsen said in a telephone interview, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be afraid of anything, really.\xe2\x80\x9d The Nets\xe2\x80\x99 Jerry Stackhouse said that Collins, his teammate for one season in Atlanta, was the perfect individual \xe2\x80\x9cto carry the flag for other players.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Jason\xe2\x80\x99s been in the league for 12 years and has had so many different teammates, he\xe2\x80\x99s got people to vouch for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stackhouse said. All of the major sports leagues have been preparing, to various degrees, for the moment when an active player comes out. The N.F.L., amid speculation that a handful of players were preparing to make the move en masse, has been working with gay advocacy groups to smooth the way for acceptance. The National Hockey League also recently announced a comprehensive program for training and counseling on gay issues for its teams and players. The N.B.A. has long included education in this area in its rookie and its veteran development programs. In his article, Collins wrote that he considered coming out a couple of years ago. He said he made the decision to do so when Joseph P. Kennedy III, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s roommate at Stanford, marched in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s gay pride parade last year. Collins said he was envious and frustrated. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to do the right thing and not hide anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to march for tolerance, acceptance and understanding. I want to take a stand and say, \xe2\x80\x98Me, too.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d'

aS'Collins becomes a free agent July 1 and intends to pursue another contract, which might be viewed as a truer test for how N.B.A. teams deal with a gay athlete.

S'Jason Collins, who played with the NBA\'s Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards this season, has disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly gay male athlete in the four major American pro team sports. The center, who said he is now a free agent, made the disclosure in a column appearing in the upcoming issue of Sports Illustrated . "I didn\'t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I\'m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different.\' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand," he wrote. Collins also wrote that the killing of three people at the Boston Marathon persuaded him to make an announcement. Things can change in a moment, so why not start living more truthfully, he wrote. On Twitter, Collins thanked everyone who sent him messages of support. "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone," he wrote . Sports Illustrated\'s managing editor said Collins was reticent about being a flag bearer. Spike Lee slams the Collins hate machine "It is a much simpler, more personal reason. He wants to have a family," Chris Stone told CNN. "He wants the same life that his twin brother, Jarron, has. This is a secret he\'s kept for a very long time. He didn\'t even inform his brother that he was gay until late last summer. ... So much for twin telepathy." Jarron, who played in the NBA for 10 seasons and was Jason\'s teammate at Stanford, tweeted to his brother: "Very proud of you." "Jason Collins has forever changed the face of sports," said the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group fighting for gay rights. It likened the announcement to Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play in major league baseball in the modern era. NBA\'s first openly gay player "At a time when millions are reflecting on the life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, Jason Collins is a hero for our own times," the group said. Former NBA player Charles Barkley, now an analyst for "Inside the NBA" on TNT, told CNN on Monday night that active players shouldn\'t be surprised that a teammate is gay. "I think anybody who thinks they never played with a gay player is an idiot," he said on "AC360." "I played with several gay players. It\'s their own business, and I think they should get to be who they want to be." Collins is a 7-footer who has played with six NBA teams -- the Wizards, Celtics, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Memphis Grizzlies and New Jersey Nets -- over the past 12 seasons. He has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 713 career games, and he has had a great deal of playoff experience with the Nets (who have since moved to Brooklyn) and the Hawks. Momentum had been growing in recent months for an active player in the National Football League, National Hockey League, National Basketball Association or Major League Baseball to come out. Just a few weeks ago, the NHL announced a new program teaching tolerance and giving support to gay athletes. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the agreement made the NHL\'s policy of inclusiveness "clear and unequivocal." "While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community, we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture with the NHL Players\' Association that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands," Bettman said in the joint statement with You Can Play. And NFL player Brendon Ayanbadejo, The New York Times reported, has been in contact with closeted players in several sports. "What we\'re trying to facilitate is to get them together and do what they want to do, do what is right for them," he told the Times. Collins paves way for gay athletes In February, former professional soccer player Robbie Rogers announced on his blog that he is gay. His former U.S. teammates showed solidarity in response to the news. Though reaction to Collins\' announcement also was overwhelming support, not everyone had a positive response. ESPN basketball analyst Chris Broussard said the Bible calls homosexuality a sin. "If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ," he said. NFL receiver Mike Wallace tweeted Monday: "All these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys SMH." He tweeted again, saying he was being misinterpreted. "Never said anything was right or wrong I just said I don\'t understand!! Deeply sorry for anyone that I offended," he wrote. The Dolphins, Wallace\'s employer, issued a statement saying the team has spoken with Wallace about the tweets. The team said it will address its policy of inclusion with all of its players. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Collins, a 34-year-old veteran, is widely respected in the league. "We are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue," he said in a statement. Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said the team is "extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly." "He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientations," Grunfeld said. Boston Celtics head coach Doc Rivers called Collins "a pro\'s pro" and one of his favorite players he ever coached. "If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept," Rivers said. "It will be society who has to learn tolerance." Bill Clinton called the announcement an "important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community." Clintons welcome announcement from friend Jason Collins Collins, who had been traded by the Celtics to the Wizards this season, wrote in his essay that U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, helped prompt his decision to come out as gay. Kennedy and Collins were roommates at Stanford. He recounts hearing about Kennedy, who is not gay, marching in Boston\'s Gay Pride Parade. "For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find," Kennedy said. "I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend." President Barack Obama called Collins "to express his support and said he was impressed by his courage," a White House official said. Active players posted their approval on Twitter. The Los Angeles Lakers\' Kobe Bryant said: "Proud of @jasoncollins34. Don\'t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others." Steve Nash, also a Laker, said: "The time has come. Maximum respect." Two Wizards players, Garrett Temple and Bradley Beal, said in tweets they were "proud" of Collins. "Much respect to my teammate," Temple said. "Great teammate, mentor and better person," said Beal. Collins\' announcement comes after the end of the Wizards\' season, and he is no longer under contract. He is an "old" player by NBA standards who has never been a star. So will he play in the NBA this fall? ESPN.com said only six of 14 team officials reached for an unofficial poll Monday thought he would be back in the league. If he does return, he probably will play only a few minutes a game for a team that needs a veteran leader, the other executives told ESPN.com. Twitter reacts to the revelation Some male athletes have come out as gay after they\'ve left professional sports. One is John Amaechi, a former NBA player. Amaechi told CNN he hopes Collins will be a catalyst for a wider acceptance of openly gay athletes, saying he believes Collins is better equipped than anyone who came before him to handle the attention that will come his way. But it may take more, Amaechi said. People like to believe one iconic figure can change things, he said, "but the reality is that when there\'s this tipping point, or enough people coming together deciding that change is necessary, that\'s when change happens." The Women\'s National Basketball Association, the women\'s pro league, has had its share of milestones and openness as far as gays are concerned. In 2005, Sheryl Swoopes, a top player in the WNBA, announced she was gay. Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in this year\'s WNBA draft, recently said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that she is gay. Griner finished her college career as the NCAA\'s all-time leading shot-blocker with 748 and as the No. 2 all-time scorer with 3,283 points. Opinion: Openly gay player is not a distraction'

S'No foul play is suspected, police said, citing the state medical examiner\'s office. It might take two months to determine the cause of death of the 22-year-old philosophy major, said Dara Chadwick of the Rhode Island Health Department. The identification was made through forensic dental examination, Chadwick said. His relatives\' search for Tripathi was detailed on a Facebook page, "Help us find Sunil Tripathi." They had temporarily taken down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when he was falsely identified on social media as a possible suspect in last week\'s Boston Marathon bombings. Tripathi was last reported seen early March 16, on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, near his home. His last recorded computer activity was shortly before that sighting. "He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected," his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. Tripathi had been on leave from the Ivy League school, meaning he was granted time off but remained a student there. He was trying to figure out what he wanted to do, Ravi told WPRI. He described his brother as a quiet person who enjoyed the little things in life. His preferred food was vegetarian, and he was a talented saxophonist, the family said. Sunil, who had been living in Providence since 2008, grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania.'

S'Sunil Tripathi\'s family had been searching for him since mid-March with help from the FBI and fellow Brown students. His sister said he left his phone, wallet and other belongings in his apartment near campus and simply disappeared. PROVIDENCE, R.I. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 A body pulled from waters off a Providence park was that of a 22-year-old Brown University student missing since last month, the Rhode Island medical examiner\'s office said Thursday. Sunil Tripathi was identified through a forensic dental exam, but a cause of death has not been determined, said Dara Chadwick, a spokeswoman for the state health department. The announcement put an end to the mystery of Tripathi\'s disappearance, which became doubly painful for his family when amateur online sleuths wrongly identified him as a possible suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. Tripathi\'s family, of Bryn Mawr, Pa., said it was overcome with grief but grateful for the outpouring of support relatives got over the last month. "As we carry indescribable grief, we also feel incredible gratitude," the Tripathi family said in a statement on a Facebook page set up to help find Tripathi, who went by Sunny. "To each one of you - from our hometown to many distant lands - we extend our thanks for the words of encouragement, for your thoughts, for your hands, for your prayers, and for the love you have so generously shared." Tripathi\'s body was found Tuesday by members of the Brown crew team off of India Point Park and was brought to shore by its coach, Providence Police Cmdr. Thomas Oates said. He said the body had been in the water for "some time." Tripathi\'s family had been searching for him since mid-March with help from the FBI and fellow Brown students. His sister, Sangeeta, said he left his phone, wallet and other belongings in his apartment near campus and simply disappeared. He was on leave from the Ivy League school, where he was studying philosophy, and had been going through a difficult time, she said. Last week, speculation swirled on Twitter and the website Reddit that Tripathi was the second of two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings because some thought he resembled one of the people in photos released by the FBI. That person turned out to be 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, authorities said. Reddit later apologized to Tripathi\'s family for fueling "online witch hunts and dangerous speculation which spiraled into very negative consequences for innocent parties." Tripathi\'s family responded to the speculation in a Facebook post that read: "A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past 12 hours. We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil." The family said in its statement Thursday that the last month "has changed our lives forever, and we hope it will change yours too." The family went on: "Take care of one another. Be gentle, be compassionate. Be open to letting someone in when it is you who is faltering. Lend your hand. We need it. The world needs it." Brown President Christina H. Paxson sent a message to the campus community Thursday, saying Tripathi - the brother of two Brown graduates- would be remembered for his "gentle demeanor and generous spirit." She described him as an accomplished saxophonist and a "serious, thoughtful, intellectually curious student and a brilliant writer."

S'It was a mystery that ended in sadness: A body found in the Providence River earlier this week has been identified as missing Brown University student Sunil Tripathi, Rhode Island officials announced Thursday. The discovery of Tripathi\'s body closed a monthlong search after his March 16 disappearance and opened the way for grief over the 22-year-old\'s death. The cause was not yet known, but investigators said they didn\'t suspect foul play. "As we carry indescribable grief, we also feel incredible gratitude," Tripathi\'s family said Thursday on a Facebook page that had been set up as part of the search. "To each one of you \xe2\x80\x93 from our hometown to many distant lands \xe2\x80\x93 we extend our thanks for the words of encouragement, for your thoughts, for your hands, for your prayers and for the love you have so generously shared.\xc2\xa0Your compassionate spirit is felt by Sunil and by all of us." His family said Tripathi, who was from Radnor, Penn., had left his apartment wearing jeans, a black fleece jacket and a Philadelphia Eagles hat, but he had left his phone and wallet behind. His family said he had struggled with depression. Sometimes canvassing by foot, sometimes hanging fliers, the searchers covered parks, hospitals, psychiatric wards, waterfronts and waterways. Tripathi\'s disappearance erroneously became intertwined with the search for the Boston Marathon bombing suspects after some social-media users noted that Tripathi resembled the fuzzy surveillance photos of "Suspect 2" from the April 15\xc2\xa0 bombing . That speculation erupted early last Friday when rumors that police had named Tripathi as a suspect turned out to be totally, mysteriously false . But during the hours before the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the suspects, damage was already done. "A tremendous and painful amount of attention has been cast on our beloved Sunil Tripathi in the past 12 hours," the family wrote Friday. \xc2\xa0"We have known unequivocally all along that neither individual suspected as responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings was Sunil."\xc2\xa0 His sister later said she got 58 calls between 3 and 4 a.m. that day, some of them vicious. That viral-rumor disaster was followed by an outpouring of love for the family across social media, with friends and Facebook users from Rhode Island to Australia writing messages for Tripathi on their hands and posting on the family\'s page. Come home safe Every day I can\'t wait to see you! Sunny I \xe2\x99\xa5 you! Mom Sunil I love you. Dad Police said the body was discovered by a Brown University rowing coach in the water at India Point Park, which juts into Providence Harbor a few blocks from Brown University. "The brother of two Brown graduates, Sunil came to Brown as an undergraduate in 2008," Brown University President Christina Paxson said in a statement. "He was a philosophy concentrator and accomplished saxophonist with a keen interest in music. He was known to be a serious, thoughtful, intellectually curious student and a brilliant writer.\xc2\xa0  Sunil will be remembered by all who knew him for his gentle demeanor and generous spirit." The family said it would remember the public\'s generosity as well. " This last month has changed our lives forever, and we hope it will change yours too," their Facebook page read Thursday. "Take care of one another. Be gentle, be compassionate. Be open to letting someone in when it is you who is faltering. Lend your hand. We need it. The world needs it."

S'The family of Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who disappeared last month \xe2\x80\x94 and was briefly misidentified as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings \xe2\x80\x94 confirmed Thursday that his body had been found near Providence, R.I. \xe2\x80\x9cOn April 23, our beloved Sunil was discovered in the waters off India Point Park in Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d his family wrote in a statement. Mr. Tripathi, 22, was taking a leave of absence from Brown when he left his apartment near campus on March 16, leaving his wallet, identification and bicycle at home. He did not return, setting off a round-the-clock search by his relatives, who temporarily moved to Providence and worked with the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to find him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very quiet, he\xe2\x80\x99s very private, he\xe2\x80\x99s very intellectual,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tripathi\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Judy, said in an interview last week. \xe2\x80\x9cHe admitted to some depression, but he said that he could figure it out, he could handle it.\xe2\x80\x9d His disappearance mystified the authorities and his family, who said they had been in daily communication with him before he left. Last Thursday, shortly after the F.B.I. released grainy surveillance photographs of the two men they believed were the Boston bombers, some Internet users began to speculate that Mr. Tripathi might be one of them. They began posting messages suggesting as much on the Facebook page the family used to raise awareness about their search for Mr. Tripathi. As the policed pursued the two suspects on a fiery chase through the Boston area, the rumor spread, leading news vans to stake out the Tripathis\xe2\x80\x99s family home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and reporters to make dozens of calls to the Tripathi family\xe2\x80\x99s cellphones. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was absolutely horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Tripathi, who said her family knew immediately that neither of the men in the photographs was her son \xe2\x80\x94 a man who they said literally would not hurt a fly, choosing instead to set insects free outside. By last Friday morning, investigators had released the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 names \xe2\x80\x94 Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \xe2\x80\x94 absolving Mr. Tripathi of any connection to the case. Apologies began to pour in to the Tripathi family \xe2\x80\x94 including one from the online forum Reddit , where users had doggedly pursued the rumor \xe2\x80\x94 who began a new social media campaign they hoped would persuade Sunil to come home. The authorities used dental records to identify the body as Mr. Tripathi\xe2\x80\x99s. They did not immediately determine the cause of his death, but said his body had been in the water for some time. \xe2\x80\x9cBe open to letting someone in when it is you who is faltering,\xe2\x80\x9d read the Tripathi family\xe2\x80\x99s statement. \xe2\x80\x9cLend your hand.

Behbehanian was arrested Monday after a customer spotted her allegedly pulling out two bottles of orange juice from a bag and putting them in the display case, he said. The customer reported it to employees, according to police. The customer also got a license plate number, and investigators later traced the plate to Behbehanian\'s residence, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said. The employees immediately pulled the bottles of orange juice from the display case, and the store was evacuated until firefighters could determine the contents of the bottles, Hutson said. The store employees pulled all the remaining juices from the cold case and destroyed them, he said. Nearby Starbucks stores were also notified of the incident and told to check the juice bottles. Hutson said the coffee chain was "immensely grateful" to the customer who alerted employees to the tainted juice bottles. Dwyer would not comment on the evidence in the case nor a possible motive, saying authorities were "still very much in investigative mode."

S'SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 A California woman faces attempted murder charges after police say she tried to sneak orange juice bottles spiked with a lethal amount of rubbing alcohol inside a Starbucks. San Jose Police arrested Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, late Monday. A customer reported seeing the woman take two bottles of orange juice from her bag and place them in an open-air refrigerated display case at a Starbucks in San Jose around 3:45 p.m., Sgt. Jason Dwyer said Tuesday. When the customer told a store manager what he saw, Behbehanian fled. A store employee followed Behbehanian to the parking lot and jotted down her license plate number as she drove off. Other employees called 911 after noticing the bottles had a toxic smell, Dwyer said. Firefighters on the scene tested the contents and determined that the bottles contained a "lethal quantity" of isopropyl rubbing alcohol mixed with the juice, Dwyer said. No one drank from the bottles, said Dwyer, who praised the customer\'s quick actions. "This person was heads-up enough and reported suspicious activity," Dwyer said. "I think that person saved lives by doing that." Officers tracked down Behbehanian Monday night at her San Jose home located about five miles away from the store. She was placed into custody on suspicion of attempted murder and felony poisoning, Dwyer said. Police are still looking for a motive. "We don\'t know if she has done this before or if she had plans to do this again," Dwyer said. "We have no reason to believe that there are other coffee shops with similar dangers." Dwyer declined to say how much rubbing alcohol was actually in the bottles, but he said it was sufficient for police to charge Behbehanian with attempted murder. The Starbucks store in San Jose was closed after Monday\'s incident but reopened the next morning, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said Tuesday. "We\'re immensely grateful to the vigilant customer who immediately did the right thing by notifying our store partners who immediately pulled the juice from the shelves and quickly notified the authorities," Hutson said. As a precaution, Hutson said that the Starbucks store in San Jose pulled all of its remaining juices from the open-air refrigerator and destroyed them. Other Starbucks nearby were also alerted and told to check all their juice bottles to make sure none of its seals were broken. Behbehanian could make her first appearance in court as soon as Thursday, authorities said. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

S'San Jose, Calif., police say a local woman with no criminal record replaced orange juice bottles in a Starbucks cold box with tainted ones \xe2\x80\x93 and they are puzzled about why she may have done it. Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, will face\xc2\xa0charges of suspicion of poisoning and attempted murder, police said. The Starbucks, located on the 6000 Block of Snell Avenue in South San Jose, Calif., was evacuated Monday evening after a customer spotted a woman switching bottles in the cold box at the front of the store with those in her bag, according to police. As the witness was notifying Starbucks employees of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s suspicious activity, police said, the suspect apparently overheard the conversation and fled the scene abruptly.\xc2\xa0A Starbucks employee was able to record the license plate of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s car. The San Jose Fire Department responded to the scene after Starbucks employees examined the bottles and found the contents had a toxic smell to them, police said. The bottles were tested with hazardous materials equipment and were found to contain a mixture of isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol, police added. Later that evening, police took Behbehanian into custody after she was found to be\xc2\xa0the owner of the car leaving the scene. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, we do not have any indication of further threats,\xe2\x80\x9d Sgt. Jason Dwyer, a spokesman for the San Jose Police Department, told ABC News. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dWe believe she acted alone and, so far, we have no further information leading us to believe that she was a part of a group.\xe2\x80\x9d Behbehanian indicated that she planned to hire an attorney, police said, but they did not know if she had yet done so. She was expected to be arraigned\xc2\xa0within the next 48 hours, Dwyer said, but a court date had not been set. In the meantime,\xc2\xa0Behbehanian\xc2\xa0was being held without bail at the Elmwood Complex Women\xe2\x80\x99s Facility. Police were still investigating a motive for the alleged incident. A spokesman for Starbucks, Zack Hutson, told ABC News that employees of the Snell Avenue Starbucks went above and beyond what they were supposed to do. \xe2\x80\x9cOur partners are trained that safety is our No. 1 concern and, in instances like this, they did exactly the right thing in calling the police,\xe2\x80\x9d Hutson said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur partners are always trained to monitor the store, including the cold case and lobby area, and to report any specious behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d Starbucks employees later emptied the contents of the rest of the cold case as a precautionary measure. Other Starbucks in the area were also warned to inspect their cold cases and to make sure everything was properly sealed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one consumed the juice and, again, our partners and our customers did the right thing by acting quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hutson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe destroyed the juice [and so did] our partner in the other area.\xe2\x80\x9d'

S'NORTON SHORES, Mich. \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 Several friends and acquaintances of a petite 25-year-old gas station clerk who went missing while working the night shift have been ruled out in her disappearance, which western Michigan investigators are treating as an abduction, the local police chief said Monday. Police have frustratingly little evidence as they search for Jessica Heeringa, who disappeared Friday night shortly before the young mother was set to close an Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores. The station didn\'t have a security camera and there were no signs of a struggle or robbery, though police have released a description of a vehicle and a man seen in the area. Norton Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw said relatives, friends and other people associated with Heeringa have been interviewed, and that investigators are "no longer really concerned with their activities from that night." "We\'re moving on, trying to find other people," Shaw said. Customers called police after finding the gas station open but no employees around. Investigators later found Herringa\'s purse and other personal belongings in the station, and the cash register untouched. Police described Herringa as 5-foot-1 and about 110 pounds. "There\'s no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed," Shaw said. "The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing. Her purse was in the store with 400-some dollars in it. It\'s just odd how that occurred." Shaw said nearly two dozen law enforcement officials are following leads. The police chief described the city, home to about 24,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan, as "quite safe" with a low rate of violent crime. "The family believes that Jessica more than likely left to help (someone) in some way," Shaw said. "Their belief is that someone that she\'s either acquainted with or someone she was trying to help lured her out." Police are searching for a gray minivan and its driver, who is described as a white man, age 30 to 40, about 6 feet tall, with light brown wavy hair. The description is from witnesses who saw the van parked near the station and driving away. Heeringa\'s mother, Shelly Heeringa, told local media that she repeatedly told her daughter she worried about her working late by herself. "She said, \'Mom, don\'t worry. I can handle anybody,\'" she said.'

S'DETROIT (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Several friends and acquaintances of a petite 25-year-old gas station clerk who went missing while working the night shift have been ruled out in her disappearance, which western Michigan investigators are treating as an abduction, the local police chief said Monday. Police have frustratingly little evidence as they search for Jessica Heeringa , who disappeared Friday night shortly before the young mother was set to close an Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores. The station didn\'t have a security camera and there were no signs of a struggle or robbery, though police have released a description of a vehicle and a man seen in the area. Norton Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw said relatives, friends and other people associated with Heeringa have been interviewed, and that investigators are "no longer really concerned with their activities from that night." "We\'re moving on, trying to find other people," Shaw said. A man trying to buy gas called police after finding the gas station open but no employees around. "There\'s nobody here," Craig Harpster , 54, told a 911 operator in a recorded conversation authorities released Monday. "I hollered, \'Hey,\' walked around the building. ... It just seems strange." Investigators later found Herringa\'s purse and other personal belongings in the station, and the cash register untouched. Police described Herringa as 5-foot-1 and about 110 pounds. "There\'s no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed," Shaw said. "The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing.

S'"Something very bad happened," the police chief of Norton Shores, a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids, told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV . "This was an abduction, not just a missing person," Chief Daniel Shaw told the station. "There was nothing disturbed inside the store. There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred," Shaw told the station. Heeringa\'s purse was left in the store, and her car was still there, WOOD reported. Heeringa last served a customer about 10:50 p.m., police said. "Between the time that last purchase was made and the time that the customers came in and found the store empty is when Jessica was abducted," Shaw told WOOD. "We have spoken with the person who made the purchase there and cleared them of any wrong. And unfortunately, they didn\'t see anything that would lead them to believe there was something going on at the store that was leading to that abduction." The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store\'s parking area late Friday. Shaw described him as a white male, between 30 and 40, with wavy hair parted in the middle, according to WOOD. The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, he told the station. The store did not have security cameras, leaving police with few other clues. "We are desperately looking for additional information," he told WOOD on Monday morning. Heeringa\'s family and friends were posting missing posters around the area, and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support. "We are searching! Hang tight! The whole Country wants you home!" said a Facebook post from Monday morning. Tips had come in from as far away as New Jersey, Missouri and Arkansas, WOOD reported. Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. She has a 3-year-old son, her family told CNN affiliate WZZM-TV . Besides local police, the county sheriff\'s department and the Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation, according to local media reports. The FBI has also been contacted, the reports said. "We\'ve got a team of detectives and investigators on staff all day and night to track down those leads," Shaw told WOOD. "We are very concerned. It\'s been too long," Heeringa\'s grandfather, Roman Homrich, told Mlive.com on Monday. Heeringa\'s mother, Shelly Heeringa, told WZZM that she thinks her daughter\'s abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store. "She\'s very helpful, that\'s why I think he lured her out of the gas station," the mother told the station. "He knew there wasn\'t security cameras." People with information that may help find Heeringa are asked to call the Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691.'
