S'But numerous questions remain about the origins of the chemical and what effect its apparent use could have on the ongoing Syrian civil war and international involvement in it. When asked whether the intelligence community\'s conclusion pushed the situation across President Barack Obama\'s "red line" that could trigger more U.S. involvement in the war, Hagel said it\'s too soon to say. "We need all the facts. We need all the information," he said. "What I\'ve just given you is what our intelligence community has said they know. As I also said, they are still assessing, and they are still looking at what happened, who was responsible and the other specifics that we\'ll need." In a letter sent to lawmakers before Hagel\'s announcement, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded "with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin." The White House cautioned that the "chain of custody" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime. Read the letter to Sen. Carl Levin (PDF) But, the letter said, "we do believe that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very likely have originated with the Assad regime." The Syrian government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years, bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance. The United Nations estimated in February that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began. Caution urged The Obama administration said it is working to gather more information on the reports and is calling for a full-scale United Nations investigation into what may have happened. "Given the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient -- only credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making," the letter said. What\'s next in Syria State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. is working with its allies to get to the bottom of what may have happened. He said the intelligence assessments were "not the final corroborative facts we\'re looking for." "We want the highest possible level of confidence because of the seriousness of the matter," he said. Lawmakers call for action After the announcement, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the United States needs to take action, but offered different proposals for what the next steps should be. "It is clear that \'red lines\' have been crossed and action must be taken to prevent larger-scale use," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement. "Syria has the ability to kill tens of thousands with its chemical weapons. The world must come together to prevent this by unified action which results in the secure containment of Syria\'s significant stockpile of chemical weapons." Rep. Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the U.S. government -- which currently supplies "nonlethal aid" to Syrian rebels -- must start "to immediately arm vetted elements of the Syrian opposition." Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, urged the administration to work for the establishment of a safe zone for Syrian rebels. "Everything that the non-interventionists said would happen in Syria if we intervened has happened," he said. "The jihadists are on the ascendency, there is chemical weapons being used, the massacres continue. "The president of the United States said that if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons that it would be a game changer, that it would cross a red line," the Arizona senator said. "I think it is pretty obvious that red line has been crossed." Later, McCain said the reported use of chemical weapons was only a matter of time and that the United States "should have intervened a long time ago whether Bashar al-Assad was using them or not." "No one should be surprised that he would do such a thing. We all know he will do whatever\'s necessary to hang on to power," McCain told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on Thursday. "And why should, frankly, chemical weapons be a red line when he\'s slaughtering and massacring, raping and torturing, his own people?" Searching for e vidence The White House letter, signed by legislative affairs director Miguel Rodriguez, indicates that the assessment is based "in part on physiological samples." On Wednesday, Syrian Free Army leader Gen. Salim Idriss told CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in several places, including Homs, Aleppo and Otaiba, near Damascus. Idriss said rebel forces had some of the people reportedly exposed to chemical weapons examined by doctors, and they took soil and blood samples. "And the samples were tested, it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons," he said. The British Foreign Office said Thursday that it had "limited but persuasive" evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, and it urged al-Assad to allow unfettered access for international investigators. Ventrell told reporters on Thursday that allowing a team of U.N. experts to investigate would be the "most direct way" to find out what happened. "We have the U.N. ready to deploy inspectors on a couple of days notice. We\'re already pre-deploying out in the field near Syria and ready to go in," he said. "And you have the regime resisting a full and thorough and credible investigation within Syria. So we urge the regime to allow these inspectors in. That currently is the most direct route to getting to the bottom of what may have occurred." Read the letter to McCain (PDF) NATO leaders discus s the issue The administration disclosure comes two days after Secretary of State John Kerry urged NATO members to prepare for the possible use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, while Russia\'s foreign minister accused the West of politicizing the search for such weapons, comparing it to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday that reports of chemical weapons in Syria must be carefully investigated to avoid a repetition of the "Iraqi scenario" in which unconfirmed allegations that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction were the basis for the U.S.-led invasion. He accused Western nations of trying to "politicize the issue" and broadening the investigation. Experts were supposed to be sent to Syria to study the possible use of chemical weapons in Aleppo. Instead, Lavrov said, investigators demanded access to all facilities in Syria and the right to interview all Syrian citizens. "I believe that is too much," he said. NATO remains conflicted about Syria\'s two-year civil war. While members are concerned about the mounting causalities, millions of refugees and the potential for a wider regional spillover, they are loath to become embroiled in another Middle Eastern conflict. Israeli evidence Earlier this week an Israeli intelligence official said Damascus was using weapons banned under international law against its own people in the country\'s civil war. On Wednesday, Israeli President Shimon Peres said that he expected the United States to fall in line with its estimate on chemical weapons use in Syria. "I think the United States and us and others will do whatever we can to meet this very dangerous weapon," he said. "The sooner the better." Syria has said it is rebels who have used chemical weapons.

S'WASHINGTON (AP) \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Syria \'s stockpile of chemical weapons could be a greater threat after that nation\'s president leaves power and could end up targeting Americans at home, lawmakers warned Sunday as they considered a U.S. response that stops short of sending military forces there. U.S. officials last week declared that the Syrian government probably had used chemical weapons twice in March, newly provocative acts in the 2-year civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The U.S. assessment followed similar conclusions from Britain, France, Israel and Qatar \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d key allies eager for a more aggressive response to the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama has said Syria\'s likely action \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d or the transfer of President Bashar Assad \'s stockpiles to terrorists \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d would cross a "red line" that would compel the United States to act. Lawmakers sought to remind viewers on Sunday news programs of Obama\'s declaration while discouraging a U.S. foothold on the ground there. "The president has laid down the line, and it can\'t be a dotted line. It can\'t be anything other than a red line," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich. "And more than just Syria, Iran is paying attention to this. North Korea is paying attention to this." Added Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Ga.: "For America to sit on the sidelines and do nothing is a huge mistake." Obama has insisted that any use of chemical weapons would change his thinking about the United States \' role in Syria but said he didn\'t have enough information to order aggressive action. "For the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues," Obama said Friday. But Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, said Sunday the United States needs to consider those weapons. She said that when Assad leaves power, his opponents could have access to those weapons or they could fall into the hands of U.S. enemies. "The day after Assad is the day that these chemical weapons could be at risk ... (and) we could be in bigger, even bigger trouble," she said. Both sides of the civil war already accuse each other of using the chemical weapons. The deadliest such alleged attack was in the Khan al-Assal village in the Aleppo province in March. The Syrian government called for the United Nations to investigate alleged chemical weapons use by rebels in the attack that killed 31 people. Syria, however, has not allowed a team of experts into the country because it wants the investigation limited to the single Khan al-Assal incident, while U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged "immediate and unfettered access" for an expanded investigation. One of Obama\'s chief antagonists on Syria, Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., said the United States should go to Syria as part of an international force to safeguard the chemical weapons. But McCain added that he is not advocating sending ground troops to the nation. "The worst thing the United States could do right now is put boots on the ground on Syria. That would turn the people against us," McCain said. His friend, Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., also said the United States could safeguard the weapons without a ground force. But he cautioned the weapons must be protected for fear that Americans could be targeted. Raising the specter of the lethal bomb at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Graham said the next attack on U.S. soil could employ weapons that were once part of Assad\'s arsenal. "Chemical weapons \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d enough to kill millions of people \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d are going to be compromised and fall into the wrong hands, and the next bomb that goes off in America may not have nails and glass in it," he said. Rogers and Schakowsky spoke to ABC\'s "This Week." Chambliss and Graham were interviewed on CBS\'s "Face the Nation." McCain appeared on NBC\'s "Meet the Press." ___ Follow Philip Elliott on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Philip_Elliott'

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The White House said Thursday that it believes the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in its civil war, an assessment that could test President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s repeated warnings that such an attack could precipitate American intervention in Syria . The White House, in a letter to Congressional leaders, said the nation\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies assessed \xe2\x80\x9cwith varying degrees of confidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the government of President Bashar al-Assad had used the chemical agent sarin on a small scale. But it said more conclusive evidence was needed before Mr. Obama would take action, referring obliquely to both the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s use of faulty intelligence in the march to war in Iraq and the ramifications of any decision to enter another conflict in the Middle East. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the agencies actually expressed more certainty about the use of these weapons than the White House indicated in its letter. She said Thursday that they voiced medium to high confidence in their assessment, which officials said was based on the testing of soil samples and blood drawn from people who had been wounded. American officials said the attacks, which occurred last month in a village near Aleppo and in the outskirts of Damascus , had not been definitively connected to Mr. Assad. The White House said the \xe2\x80\x9cchain of custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the weapons was not clear, raising questions about whether the attacks were deliberate or accidental. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said in the letter, which was signed by its legislative director, Miguel E. Rodriguez. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making.\xe2\x80\x9d That meticulously legal language did not disguise a thorny political and foreign policy problem for Mr. Obama: he has long resisted the calls to arm the Syrian rebels and has expressed deep doubts about the wisdom of intervening in an Arab nation so riven with sectarian strife, although he has also issued pointed warnings to Syria. In a statement last summer, Mr. Obama did not offer a technical definition of his \xe2\x80\x9cred line\xe2\x80\x9d for taking action, but said it was when \xe2\x80\x9cwe start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized.\xe2\x80\x9d In Jerusalem last month, he said proof that Syria had used such weapons would be a \xe2\x80\x9cgame changer\xe2\x80\x9d for American involvement . The Pentagon, administration officials said, has prepared the president a menu of options that include commando raids that would secure chemical weapons stockpiles and strikes on Syrian planes from American ships in the Mediterranean. Last year, the United States secretly sent a 150-member task force to Jordan to help deal with the possibility that Syria would lose control of its stockpiles. Mr. Obama could also provide more robust aid to the rebels, including weapons. White House officials gave no indication of what Mr. Obama might do, except to say that any American action would be taken in concert with its allies. While lawmakers from both parties swiftly declared that the president\xe2\x80\x99s red line had been breached, they differed on what he should do about it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe political reality is that he put himself in that position that if the \xe2\x80\x98red line\xe2\x80\x99 is crossed \xe2\x80\x94 he made it very clear \xe2\x80\x94 it would change his behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said. The intelligence \xe2\x80\x9cis a compelling argument for the president to take the measures that a lot of us have been arguing for all along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The timing of the White House disclosure also suggested the pressures it is facing. It came the same day that the British government said that it had \xe2\x80\x9climited but persuasive\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and two days after an Israeli military intelligence official asserted that Syria had repeatedly used chemical weapons. In a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, several weeks ago calling for a United Nations investigation, Britain laid out evidence of the attacks in Aleppo and near Damascus as well as an earlier one in Homs. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, reported that dozens of victims were treated at hospitals for shortness of breath, convulsions and dilation of the pupils, common symptoms of exposure to chemical warfare agents. Doctors reported eye irritation and fatigue after close exposure to the patients. Citing its links to contacts in the Syrian opposition, Britain said there were reports of 15 deaths in the suburban Damascus attack and up to 10 in Aleppo, where the government and rebels have each accused the other of using chemical weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately the deaths have not been high,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Feinstein said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there have been deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d The United States has also pushed for a United Nations investigation, but it made clear on Thursday that it has collected enough evidence on its own and with Britain and other countries to make its assessment. An official said the United States was also suspicious about the attack in Homs. While several officials said the intelligence agencies expressed medium to high confidence about its overall assessment, two intelligence officials noted that there were components of the assessment about which the agencies were less certain. They did not offer details. Administration officials had begun the week casting doubt on the claims made by the Israeli official, Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, about chemical weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cSuspicions are one thing; evidence is another,\xe2\x80\x9d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday on a visit to Egypt. But by then, a senior administration official said, the intelligence agencies had already become more confident of their assessment, after several weeks of examining the evidence. With Secretary of State John Kerry scheduled to brief senators on Syria on Thursday, the White House decided on Wednesday evening to get ahead of that meeting. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure came in a response to Mr. McCain, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the committee\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, who wrote to the White House asking whether Mr. Assad or his supporters had used chemical weapons during the two-year-long war. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the fact that we have been developing additional information within our intelligence community,\xe2\x80\x9d a White House official said to reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cwe felt it was the right and prudent thing to do to respond in an unclassified form to this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d Lawmakers generally welcomed the White House\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure, though some suggested that the administration was still inclined to play down the implications of the assessment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that we read the intelligence as it is laid out, not as we would like it to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.'

S'ANTAKYA, Turkey \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Syrian activists have lashed out at signs the U.S. remains reluctant to intervene in the country\'s civil war despite growing evidence President Bashar al-Assad\'s forces have used chemical weapons against his people. "I hope there will be a reaction from America, but I don\'t think there will be," said Bassam al Ahmed, 31, a Kurdish human rights activist from Qamishli in Syria. "(But) if the U.N. and the U.S. don\'t take any action of any kind, the Syrian regime will only have more time, and it would be a green light for the regime to use chemical weapons in the future." The Obama administration said Thursday it could say with "varying degrees of confidence" that chemical weapons, including sarin gas, had been used at least twice by Syrian government forces on separate occasions in suburban Damascus and Aleppo. In the Syrian capital however, a government official said Assad\'s military "did not and will not use chemical weapons even if it had them." He instead accused opposition forces of using them in a March attack on the village of Khan al-Assad outside of the northern city of Aleppo. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements. Syrian rebel groups including the Syrian Network for Human Rights \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d which told USA TODAY on Thursday they had amassed evidence including videos, photos and eyewitness testimony that showed the weapons had been used in 10 separate locations in the war-torn country \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d called for a Western military-enforced no-fly zone and heavier artillery, such as rocket launchers. But even though President Obama had said the regime\'s use of chemical weapons would be the "red line" for the U.S., White House officials said the revelation would not lead to immediate intervention. Instead they called for further U.N. investigation to "credibly evaluate the evidence and establish what took place". "Clearly there appears to be circumstantial evidence that that has taken place," said David Hartwell, a Middle East analyst at IHS Jane, defense and security analysts in London. "The alleged low-level usage sarin leaves open the possibility that it may not have occurred in terms of Syrian government complicity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d it could be a rogue unit." "From that point of view, I think the administration has plenty of latitude to say, hold on a second, we didn\'t mean that would immediately trigger intervention," he added. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said in an interview with the BBC that he supported Obama on the principle of the use of chemical weapons as a "red line" and added they were looking for ways to "put pressure on the regime so we can bring it to an end." "We need to go on gathering this evidence and also to send a very clear warning to the Syrian regime about these appalling actions," he said. Activists reacted with anger. "If you take the examples of Iraq and Syria, you can conclude only one thing: unless there is a strong financial incentive, the international community doesn\'t intervene anywhere," said U.K.-based Syrian activist Abdulwahab Omar. "In Iraq they acted because of a suspicion there were weapons of mass destruction, but there was a financial incentive. In Syria, there is a piling amount of evidence of crimes against humanity, but no financial incentive," he said. While western governments attempt to gather more evidence, activists said they hoped the U.S. would act soon. "The USA never thought the Syrian government would use chemical weapons, and the red line was to buy them time not to react; it was just an excuse," said Nour Hameedo, 25, from the Idlib province in Syria, talking from Antakya. "I don\'t think that anyone will react in the international community, if they wanted to, they would have done something earlier," he said. Contributing: Charles McPhedran and Jennifer Collins.'

S"BEIRUT \xe2\x80\x94 Last week\xe2\x80\x99s allegations from top U.S. officials that Syrian forces probably deployed chemical weapons against rebels come amid an array of disputed\xc2\xa0 reports about purported chemical attacks in Syria. There have been at least three incidents \xe2\x80\x94 all unconfirmed \xe2\x80\x94 in which reports surfaced publicly that chemical weapons had been deployed in Syria, either by the government or rebels. All have been relatively small scale considering the fact that agents such as sarin can cause mass casualties. It's not clear which, if any, of the incidents are involved in the U.S. allegations against Syria. The most high-profile of the incidents allegedly occurred on March 19 in the town of Khan al Asal, outside the northern city of Aleppo. The government said 25 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded in a poison-gas assault. The government and the opposition exchanged blame for the attack, a pattern of cross-accusations that has recurred repeatedly following mass killings in Syria. But accounts from both sides agreed that the casualties occurred after a rocket strike and included both civilians and an unspecified number of regime troops. The Syrian government said \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d based in a nearby area launched a rocket at 7:30 a.m. containing \xe2\x80\x9cchemical materials.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The rocket struck about 300 yards from a Syrian army post, the state press agency said. The opposition countered that the Syrian military fired a chemical-tipped Scud missile. According to the official account, the casualties resulted from both the explosion and the gases unleashed upon impact. It was never clear how many of the victims succumbed to the alleged gas. Official video and photographs said to be from a hospital in Aleppo showed purported victims breathing through oxygen masks. The substance caused \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate fainting, convulsion and death,\xe2\x80\x9d the Syrian information minister, Omran Zoubi, told reporters. The government suggested that rebels may have armed a missile with a chlorine derivative looted from an Aleppo factory. Chlorine, widely used as a water purifier and in other industrial applications, was deployed on a large scale as a chemical weapon almost a century ago in the trenches of World War I. Some accounts of the March 19 attack\xc2\xa0 indicated that the odor of chlorine was noticeable at the site. Experts interviewed after the attack generally said that the casualty numbers would have been much higher if the missile had been armed with a nerve agent like sarin, which is believed to be in the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal. After the attack, Syrian officials alleged that the opposition used a laboratory in adjoining Turkey to fabricate the toxic material. The aim, according to Syrian officials, was to create a false-flag scenario in which the Syrian military was accused of deploying chemical weapons \xe2\x80\x94 thus triggering international intervention . The Syrian government reportedly took soil samples from the site and blood samples from victims to be used in any\xc2\xa0 United Nations investigation. As the March incident caused an international uproar, the opposition charged that the government had also fired chemical weapons on the same day in the disputed township of Otaybah, east of Damascus, the capital. Details about that alleged attack have remained sketchy, though rebels say the strike caused both deaths and injuries. The opposition has since alleged several other incidents involving chemical gas attacks. The first flurry of allegations about chemical weapons use in Syria involved an incident late last year in the heavily contested central city of Homs. On its website, Foreign Policy magazine in January cited a secret State Department cable that concluded, after an extensive consular investigation, that Syrian authorities probably deployed chemical weapons on Dec. 23 in Homs. However, the U.S. State Department later categorically distanced itself from the report, which it said was based on \xe2\x80\x9canecdotal\xe2\x80\x9d information.\xc2\xa0 State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington on Jan. 16 that investigators \xe2\x80\x9cfound no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used\xe2\x80\x9d last December in Homs. When the U.S. charged last week that it appeared Syria had used sarin gas in unspecified attacks, the Syrian government denounced the allegations as a \xe2\x80\x9cbare-faced lie.\xe2\x80\x9d A top Russian diplomat warned in a visit to Lebanon this weekend that the charges should not be used as an \xe2\x80\x9cpretext\xe2\x80\x9d for an Iraq-style intervention in Syria, Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s long-time ally. Still, the explosive\xc2\xa0 accusations raised\xc2\xa0 the specter that Damascus may have crossed the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cred line\xe2\x80\x9d for possible stepped-up\xc2\xa0 intervention in the conflict, which has been going on for more than two years. U.S. officials conceded that the proof of two reported instances of the nerve agent was not conclusive, and the \xe2\x80\x9cchain of custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the substances was unclear. Experts say it is almost impossible to make an accurate determination without access to the impacted site and laboratory examinations of samples of soil, blood, urine or human tissue. The evidence that has emerged publicly so far appears to involve photographs of purported victims and alleged traces of toxins found in individuals and possibly in soil. A planned United Nations\xc2\xa0 inquiry remains stalled amid differences between the U.N. and the Syrian government about how much access the investigators will have in the country.

S'By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal officials vowed on Monday to ensure the safety of climbers seeking to scale Mount Everest after three European climbers were involved in a fight with sherpa guides on their way to the peak of the world\'s highest mountain. Three experienced climbers from Britain, Italy and Switzerland were on route to camp three at 7,000 meters (22,965 feet) on the 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) Everest summit when a brawl broke out on Saturday with sherpas fixing their ropes. Witnesses said the sherpas pelted the Europeans\' tents with stones and punches were thrown. Swiss climber Ueli Steck descended to the base camp after the attack and said he would abandon the climb and return to Kathmandu if proper security was not ensured. Nepali officials were quick to respond after the unusual brawl on Mount Everest, which is a key source of income for impoverished Nepal as foreign climbers pay royalties to scale the world\'s highest peak. Tourism Ministry official Dipendra Paudel said the government would ensure the safety and security of the climbers. "There was a slight misunderstanding and communication gap between them," Paudel said in Kathmandu after contacting the base camp. "This has been sorted out and the climbers are at the base camp." He said the European climbers would resume their bid to climb Everest. Officials said hundreds of climbers from 32 expeditions and their sherpas were on Mount Everest in the current climbing season which continues through May. Sherpas are locals from the Everest region and are noted for their climbing skills. They are responsible for fixing ropes and accompany most of the foreign climbers to the summit. Beni Hyoju, an official of the Cho-Oyu Trekking agency that organized the expedition, said the three European climbers had failed to comply with a request from their sherpa guides to stay at a location while the guides fixed the route. Hyoju said this made the sherpas unhappy and they attacked the climbers. No one was critically wounded. "(Steck) has now agreed to continue the climb after local administration assured proper security," Hyoju said. "Sherpas who were responsible for the fight will offer (an) apology." Historian Elizabeth Hawley, who has been tracking foreign expeditions to Mount Everest for more than five decades, said this type of fighting on the mountain was rare. "I have not heard of any such incident before," said Hawley. About 4,000 climbers have reached the top of Everest since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Also on Yahoo!

S'But a group of three climbers say they faced unexpected adversaries over the weekend while scaling the storied peak: Sherpa guides. Nepalese authorities say they\'re investigating reports that a fight broke out on Saturday between the guides and the climbers, nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) up the world\'s tallest mountain. "If the Sherpas hit the foreign climbers, action will definitely be taken against them," said Dipendra Poudel, a mountaineering official in Kathmandu. The fight started after three professional climbers from Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland told the Sherpas they wanted to climb on their own, according to Nima Nuru Sherpa of Cho-Oyu Trekking, the agency that is managing their climb. "Our clients said the Sherpas manhandled them," he said. A statement posted Sunday on the website of Italian climber Simone Moro gave a harrowing account, claiming that 100 Sherpas attacked him, Swiss climber Ueli Steck and British climber Jonathan Griffith. This account said the fight broke out after Sherpas said the climbers knocked ice onto a Sherpa located below them. "They became instantly aggressive," the statement said, "and not only punched and kicked the climbers, but threw many rocks as well." After nearly an hour, the situation calmed down, the statement said. "The climbers, who had been pushed away and told to hide, had regrouped and were told that if they weren\'t gone in one hour that they would all be killed," the statement said. "The climbers packed the bare essentials and made a circuitous route back down to the base of Mount Everest in heavily crevassed terrain with no rope on, feeling that given the current situation this was the safest place to be." Nepalese authorities said their investigation into the report was ongoing. "The Sherpas got angry when hit by the ice and there was a fight," said Dambar Parajuli of the Expedition Operators\' Association, a group representing expedition organizers. In addition, he said, the climbers had been instructed not to go up while Sherpas were laying ropes, but they went ahead despite the warning. On Monday, he said, both sides had a meeting, reconciled and agreed to go ahead with the climb. In their statement on Sunday, the climbers said no Sherpa had come forward with any evidence of injury. "The climbers believe that the lead Sherpa was tired and cold and felt that his pride had been damaged as the three climbers were moving unroped and much faster to the side of him," the statement said. "Whatever the reason may be, there is no reason to instigate vigilante rule and to try and kill three visiting climbers." About 4,000 people have scaled Everest since Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first climbed the mountain in 1953. According to mountaineering officials, 340 foreign climbers from about 30 expeditions have been given permission to climb Everest this year with about the same number of high-altitude Sherpas set to assist them. The majority of climbers are on commercial expeditions and are aided by Sherpas to reach the summit. Sherpas from different expeditions put down ropes to the summit and later, other climbers hold on to them to scale the mountain. Turning Everest waste into art Among climbing enthusiasts on social media, word spread quickly of the fight in one of the world\'s most hard-to-reach, but well known, locales. In a Facebook post, Climb Magazine described what it called a "shocking scene" on the mountain , sparking debate among readers over whether the Sherpas or the climbers were responsible. One post on Adventure Journal\'s website described the incident as "an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on Mt. Everest." In another post, a guide said mistakes were likely made on both sides , but that those responsible for the violence should be prosecuted. "Everest is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts. This is true for professional and recreational climbers, and for Sherpa who earn most or all of their family\'s annual income in these two months on the mountain," guide Adrian Ballinger wrote. "The constant pressure to break records, attempt new routes, and be the strongest, whether for personal pride, sponsors, future job offers, or media, can cloud the purity of our climbing here. And these pressures can lead to disagreements, arguments, and hurt feelings. But none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence, or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other," Ballinger added.

S'The suspect, a 35-year-old Dutch citizen, traveled around Spain in a van he used as a mobile office, Spain\'s National Police said in a statement Sunday. Police arrested him Thursday north of Barcelona, Spain, on a European arrest warrant at the request of judicial authorities in the Netherlands, the statement said. Authorities have not released his name, and a photo police issued showing his detention blurred his face. The arrest comes a month after Internet users around the globe faced slowed-down service during the prolonged denial-of-service assault on The Spamhaus Project , a European spam-fighting group. Security experts said the attack used more sophisticated techniques than most distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks and targeted the Web\'s infrastructure, which led to other sites performing slowly. In a DDoS attack, computers flood a website with requests, overwhelming its servers and causing it to crash or become inaccessible for many users. Last month\'s attack appears to be part of a fierce feud between organizations that monitor spam and try to block it and companies that accuse spam blockers of unjustly blacklisting them. The Spamhaus Project is a nonprofit that patrols the Internet for spammers and publishes a list of Web servers those spammers use. Matthew Prince, CEO of Internet security firm CloudFlare, estimates the group may be responsible for up to 80% of all spam that gets blocked. And last month, the group added a new name to its blacklist, CyberBunker, and said spammers use the company as a host to spray junk mail across the Web. During his arrest, the suspect told authorities he was a diplomat and "minister of telecommunications and foreign relations of the Republic of CyberBunker," police said Sunday. Last month CyberBunker -- a Dutch company housed in a former NATO nuclear bunker -- did not take credit for the attack against Spamhaus but didn\'t shy away from talking about it. "This here is the Internet community puking out Spamhaus," Sven Olaf Kamphuis of CyberBunker told CNN in March. "We\'ve had it with the guys. ... What we see right here is the Internet puking out a cancer." Kamphuis and other critics say that Spamhaus oversteps its bounds and has essentially destroyed innocent websites in its spam-fighting efforts. "Spamhaus itself is a more urgent danger" than spam, Kamphuis told CNN. "Pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down and then they get it shut down without any court order. That is a significantly larger threat to internet and freedom of speech and net neutrality than anything else." In a statement Friday, Spamhaus thanked Dutch authorities for last week\'s arrest. "Spamhaus will resolutely continue its mission to provide reliable protection against cyberthreats such as spam, malware and botnets and work with Internet service providers and organizations worldwide to create a safer Internet," the organization said in a statement.'

S'A Dutchman thought to be associated with the "biggest cyberattack\n in history" last month reportedly has been arrested in Spain. The Dutch justice ministry announced on its\n  website today (April 26) that a 35-year-old Dutchman,\n  identified only by the initials SK, had been detained on a\n  European warrant yesterday (April 25) in the Barcelona area. The ministry\'s press release said SK was suspected in "severe"\n \n distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the\n anti-spam organization Spamhaus and Spamhaus partners in the\n Netherlands, the United States and Britain. During the \n week-long series of attacks on Spamhaus , Sven Olaf Kamphuis,\n a Dutchman in his mid-30s, emerged as the spokesman for Stophaus,\n the group leading the attacks, which at one point reached an\n unprecedented 300 gigabits per second. After the New York Times published an article saying the attacks\n were causing "widespread congestion and jamming crucial\n infrastructure around the world," Kamphuis disappeared from view.\n (The congestion was felt primarily in the London area, northern\n Germany and the Netherlands.) Security researcher Brian Krebs noted that Kamphuis\' Facebook\n  account said he was a native of Amsterdam living in Barcelona.\n  The last posting on the account was on Wednesday (April 24). [ How\n DDoS Attacks Threaten the Internet ] In March, Kamphuis portrayed himself to various media outlets as\n one of the founders of CyberBunker, a Dutch Web-hosting service\n that proudly proclaims it will take any customers except\n terrorists or child pornographers. CyberBunker, named for the nuclear-blast-proof NATO bunker it\n purports to house its servers in, has a lot of unsavory clients,\n including accused cybercriminals, spammers and peddlers of fake\n pharmaceuticals. Subsequent reports have said CyberBunker moved out of the bunker\n years ago. Krebs said CyberBunker\'s official "WHOIS" listing puts\n the company in Antarctica. Because of its nasty clients, Spamhaus put CyberBunker\'s range of\n Internet addresses on its email and Web blacklists, which are\n used by many Internet service providers worldwide to weed out\n spam and unsavory material. Kamphuis and Stophaus complained that Spamhaus\' efforts were\n illegal and declared that if Spamhaus would block its clients,\n its clients would blockade Spamhaus with DDoS attacks, bombarding\n Spamhaus and its own ISPs with huge amounts of useless Internet\n traffic.

S'A Dutch citizen suspected of involvement in what experts describe as the biggest cyberattack in the history of the Internet has been arrested. THE HAGUE, Netherlands\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 A Dutch citizen has been arrested in Spain in connection with what experts described as the biggest cyberattack in the history of the Internet,\xc2\xa0launched against an anti-spam watchdog group last month, prosecutors announced Friday. The Netherlands National Prosecution Office said a 35-year-old suspect it identified only by his initials, S.K., was arrested Thursday at his home in Barcelona. Authorities also seized computers and mobile phones. Dutch prosecutors do not release full names of suspects, in line with privacy laws. According to a prosecution statement, the man is suspected of "unprecedentedly serious attacks on the non-profit organization Spamhaus." He was held on a European arrest warrant and is expected to be extradited to the Netherlands to face justice. The so-called denial-of-service attack on Spamhaus fired a torrent of data at the organization\'s servers and was blamed for other disruptions online. Dutch banks and an electronic payment service also have been hit by similar attacks in recent weeks, but prosecutors say they do not believe they are linked to the Spamhaus incident. Spamhaus, a site responsible for keeping ads for counterfeit Viagra and bogus weight-loss pills out of the world\'s inboxes, said it apparently was targeted by groups angry at being blacklisted by the Swiss-British group. Prosecutors said the cyberattack also hit "partners" of Spamhaus in the United States, the Netherlands and Britain. At the time, Vincent Hanna, a researcher with Spamhaus, called it a "small miracle" the organization had remained online during the cyber onslaught. Denial-of-service attacks overwhelm a server with traffic \xe2\x80\x94 like hundreds of letters being jammed through a mail slot at the same time. Security experts measure those attacks in bits of data per second. Recent cyberattacks \xe2\x80\x94 such as the ones that caused persistent outages at U.S. banking sites late last year \xe2\x80\x94 have tended to peak at 100 billion bits per second. But the assault on Spamhaus shattered the charts, clocking in at 300 billion bits per second, according to San Francisco-based CloudFlare Inc., which Spamhaus enlisted to help it weather the attack. \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 MSN News on Facebook and Twitter Stay up to date on breaking news and current events.

S'NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 With the simplest of sentences, NBA veteran Jason Collins set aside years of worry and silence to become the first active player in one of four major U.S. professional sports leagues to come out as gay. In a first-person article posted Monday on Sports Illustrated\'s website, Collins begins: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Collins has played for six teams in 12 seasons, most recently as a reserve with the Washington Wizards after a midseason trade from the Boston Celtics. He is now a free agent and wants to keep playing in the NBA. "I didn\'t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I\'m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different,"\' Collins writes. "If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand." Saying he had "endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie," Collins immediately drew support for his announcement from the White House -- President Barack Obama called him -- along with former President Bill Clinton, the NBA, current and former teammates, a sponsor, and athletes in other sports. Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant tweeted that he was proud of Collins, writing: "Don\'t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others," followed by the words "courage" and "support." "We\'ve got to get rid of the shame. That\'s the main thing. And Jason\'s going to help that. He\'s going to help give people courage to come out," said Billie Jean King, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who confirmed she was gay after being outed in the early 1980s. "I guarantee you he\'s going to feel much lighter, much freer. The truth does set you free, there\'s no question. It doesn\'t mean it\'s easy. But it sets you free," King said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. The Wizards, whose season ended April 17, issued a statement from President Ernie Grunfeld: "We are extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly. He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientation." Collins\' coach with the Celtics, Doc Rivers, drew a comparison between Monday\'s announcement and Jackie Robinson\'s role when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball. "I am extremely happy and proud of Jason Collins. He\'s a pro\'s pro. He is the consummate professional and he is one of my favorite `team\' players I have ever coached," Rivers said. "If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept. It will be society who has to learn tolerance." Collins says he quietly made a statement for gay rights even while keeping his sexual orientation a secret. He wore No. 98 with the Celtics and Wizards -- 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, was killed, and the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization, was founded. According to the General Social Survey, the public has grown increasingly accepting of gay relationships since the late 1980s. That survey found in 1987 that 76 percent of Americans thought sexual relations between adults of the same sex was morally wrong. That fell to 43 percent by 2012. "I\'m glad I\'m coming out in 2013 rather than 2003. The climate has shifted; public opinion has shifted," Collins writes. "And yet we still have so much farther to go. Everyone is terrified of the unknown, but most of us don\'t want to return to a time when minorities were openly discriminated against." While some gay athletes have talked in the past about concerns that coming out would hurt their earning potential, 12-time Grand Slam singles champion King said she thinks Collins\' openness could have the opposite effect. "I have a feeling he\'s got a whole new career," King said. "I have a feeling he\'s going to make more in endorsements than he\'s ever made in his life." Sports equipment maker Nike released a statement Monday saying: "We admire Jason\'s courage and are proud that he is a Nike athlete. Nike believes in a level playing field where an athlete\'s sexual orientation is not a consideration." On Monday evening, hours after his story appeared on the web, Collins wrote on Twitter: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone." Momentum has been building toward this sort of announcement from a pro athlete in a top league in the United States. NFL players Brendan Ayanbadejo and Chris Kluwe were outspoken in support of state gay-marriage amendments during last year\'s elections. Obama spoke about his support for gay marriage during his re-election campaign. The topic made waves during Super Bowl week when one player, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver, said he wouldn\'t welcome a gay member of his team. At the time, Ayanbadejo estimated that at least half of the NFL\'s players would agree with what Culliver said, at least privately. Scott Fujita, who recently retired after an 11-year NFL career, said: "I\'m pleased to see such an overwhelmingly positive reaction to this news, because it just shows that we\'re becoming more accepting every day. But more than anything else, I\'m happy for Jason. I\'m not a gay, closeted athlete, so I can\'t pretend to know what that must have felt like for him. But I imagine this is freeing for him, and hopefully he\'s encouraged by the millions of people who are voicing their support. ... It\'s not a reaction to some rumor and it\'s not some unwanted outing. It\'s his message, and it was delivered under his control and on his terms." On Monday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams reiterating the league\'s anti-discrimination policy about sexuality. It includes a section on questions teams cannot ask prospective draft picks and free agents. After the NFL combine in February, three players said officials posed questions about sexual orientation. Earlier this month, the NHL and its players\' union partnered with an advocacy organization fighting homophobia in sports, and Commissioner Gary Bettman said the You Can Play Project underlines that "the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands." "I would say the NHL has been a force to kind of obviously embrace and encourage. ... What (Collins) did, I think it\'s definitely (good) for basketball, and the same for hockey, too. It\'s going to be encouraging for more guys to step up and just be open about themselves," Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward said. Living in the nation\'s capital last month while the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about same-sex marriage had an effect on Collins, who says "the strain of hiding my sexuality became almost unbearable" at that time. "Less than three miles from my apartment, nine jurists argued about my happiness and my future. Here was my chance to be heard, and I couldn\'t say a thing," he writes. "I didn\'t want to answer questions and draw attention to myself." After being a first-round draft pick in 2001, Collins has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds for the New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Celtics and Wizards. In his SI piece, he jokes self-effacingly about his journeyman career and a parlor game known as "Three Degrees of Jason Collins." "If you\'re in the league, and I haven\'t been your teammate, I surely have been one of your teammates\' teammates. Or one of your teammates\' teammates\' teammates," he writes. Never a star, he acknowledges, "I take charges and I foul -- that\'s been my forte. ... I set picks with my 7-foot, 255-pound body to get guys like Jason Kidd, John Wall and Paul Pierce open. I sacrifice myself for other players." He continues: "I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: That guy is gay? But I\'ve always been an aggressive player, even in high school. Am I so physical to prove that being gay doesn\'t make you soft? Who knows? That\'s something for a psychologist to unravel." As for what response other NBA players will have to his revelation, Collins writes: "The simple answer is, I have no idea." "Openness may not completely disarm prejudice, but it\'s a good place to start. It all comes down to education. I\'ll sit down with any player who\'s uneasy about my coming out," he says in his account, adding: "Still, if I\'m up against an intolerant player, I\'ll set a pretty hard pick on him. And then move on." On Monday, there was an outpouring of positive sentiments. In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out. He was a great teammate," and rookie Bradley Beal said: "I didn\'t know about it! I don\'t think anyone did! I am proud of his decision to come out and express the way he feels and I\'m supportive of that!!" Former teammate Jerry Stackhouse, now with the Brooklyn Nets, wrote in a text: "I hope Jason is received well by our NBA family. Jason is a friend and a former teammate that I\'ve enjoyed many laughs and conversations with and his sexual orientation won\'t change that with me. I\'ve already reached out to him personally to show support and will encourage more guys to do the same." NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement: "Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue." While Collins is the first male athlete in a major North American professional league to come out while intending to keep playing, several have previously spoken after they retired about being gay, including the NBA\'s John Amaechi, the NFL\'s Esera Tuaolo and Major League Baseball\'s Billy Bean. "I think he is immensely brave. I think it\'s a shame in this day and age he has to be immensely brave, but he is," Amaechi told the AP. "He\'s going to be a remarkable and eloquent spokesperson for what it is to be a decent, authentic human being -- never mind just for gay people." Rick Welts, president and chief operating officer of the NBA\'s Golden State Warriors, is openly gay. "He probably knows what he signed up for. There\'ll be a whole bunch more television reporters and cameras than he\'s probably had in the past. ... There had been a long of speculation about when, who, how. I think that speculation has been put to rest now," Welts said, "and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first man to do this." Collins says that if he remains in the NBA, he could face uncomfortable reactions from spectators. "I don\'t mind if they heckle me. I\'ve been booed before. There have been times when I\'ve wanted to boo myself. But a lot of ill feelings can be cured by winning," he writes. He adds: "I hope fans will respect me for raising my hand. And I hope teammates will remember that I\'ve never been an in-your-face kind of guy. All you need to know is that I\'m single. I see no need to delve into specifics." In February, former U.S. soccer national team player Robbie Rogers said he was gay -- and retired at the same time. Rogers is just 25, and others have urged him to resume his career. "I feel a movement coming," he tweeted after word of Collins\' news broke. Female athletes have found more acceptance in coming out; Brittney Griner, a top college basketball player now headed to the WNBA, caused few ripples when she said this month she is a lesbian. Tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out decades ago, tweeted Monday that Collins is "a brave man." "1981 was the year for me -- 2013 is the year for you," her post added. Sports leagues in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been trying to combat anti-gay bias. But the taboo remains particularly strong in soccer, where there are no openly gay players in Europe\'s top leagues. Homophobic chants are still heard at some games. Soccer "is not going to change," said Amaechi, who is English and now lives in Manchester. "If it wanted to change, it would change. It has the resources to do so. It doesn\'t want to change." Justin Fashanu is the only significant British soccer player to have come out publicly, doing so in 1990. The former Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker was found hanged in a London garage in 1998 at age 37. According to an inquest, Fashanu left a note saying that, because he was gay, he feared he wouldn\'t get a fair trial in the United States on sexual assault charges. Maryland police were seeking him on charges that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old boy. Among other athletes outside the U.S. to come out was Gareth Thomas, a Welsh rugby star who attracted widespread media attention in 2009 when he announced he was gay. He continued playing until retirement in 2011. Orlando Cruz of Puerto Rico came out in October as the first openly gay professional male boxer. Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury came out six years after winning a gold medal in the backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Four-time Olympic diving gold medalist Greg Louganis of the U.S. revealed he was gay in 1994, a year before announcing he was also HIV-positive. Former Olympic skiing gold medalist Anja Paerson of Sweden announced last year, after retiring, that she was in a long-term relationship with a woman. White House spokesman Jay Carney called Collins\' decision courageous and said the administration views it as another example of progress and evolution in the U.S. as Americans grow more accepting of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Former President Clinton said: "Jason\'s announcement today is an important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community. It is also the straightforward statement of a good man who wants no more than what so many of us seek: to be able to be who we are; to do our work; to build families and to contribute to our communities. For so many members of the LGBT community, these simple goals remain elusive." Collins attended Stanford with Clinton\'s daughter Chelsea and played in a Final Four while at the school. His twin brother, Jarron, was also a longtime NBA center who last played in the league in the 2010-11 season. Collins says he told his brother he was gay last summer. "He was downright astounded. He never suspected. So much for twin telepathy," Collins writes in SI. "But by dinner that night, he was full of brotherly love. For the first time in our lives, he wanted to step in and protect me." Advocacy organization GLAAD released a statement from Aaron McQuade, the head of its sports program. "Courage\' and `inspiration\' are words that get thrown around a lot in sports, but Jason Collins has given both ideas a brand new context," he said. "We hope that his future team will welcome him, and that fans of the NBA and sports in general will applaud him. We know that the NBA will proudly support him, and that countless young LGBT athletes now have a new hero." At Stanford, Collins was a college roommate of Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. In his account, Collins writes that he realized he needed to go public when the congressman walked in Boston\'s gay pride parade last year -- and Collins decided he couldn\'t join him. "For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find. Without question or hesitation, he gives everything he\'s got to those of us lucky enough to be in his life. I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend," Kennedy said in a statement. In Monday\'s story, Collins writes that the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city\'s 2013 gay rights parade. "Some people insist they\'ve never met a gay person. But Three Degrees of Jason Collins dictates that no NBA player can claim that anymore. Pro basketball is a family. And pretty much every family I know has a brother, sister or cousin who\'s gay," Collins concludes. "In the brotherhood of the NBA, I just happen to be the one who\'s out."'

aS'Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?'
p1041
aS'" And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city\'s 2013 gay rights parade.'

aS'In a first-person article posted Monday on Sports Illustrated\'s website, Collins begins: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay."'
p1044
aS'Collins has played for six teams in 12 seasons, most recently as a reserve with the Washington Wizards after a midseason trade from the Boston Celtics. He is now a free agent and wants to keep playing in the NBA.'
p1045
aS'"I didn\'t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I\'m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different,"\' Collins writes. "If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand."'
p1046
aS'Saying he had "endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie," Collins immediately drew support for his announcement from the White House -- President Barack Obama called him -- along with former President Bill Clinton, the NBA, current and former teammates, a sponsor, and athletes in other sports.'
p1047
aS'Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant tweeted that he was proud of Collins, writing: "Don\'t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others," followed by the words "courage" and "support."'
p1048
aS'"We\'ve got to get rid of the shame. That\'s the main thing. And Jason\'s going to help that. He\'s going to help give people courage to come out," said Billie Jean King, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who confirmed she was gay after being outed in the early 1980s.'
p1049
aS'"I guarantee you he\'s going to feel much lighter, much freer. The truth does set you free, there\'s no question. It doesn\'t mean it\'s easy. But it sets you free," King said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.'
p1050
aS'The Wizards, whose season ended April 17, issued a statement from President Ernie Grunfeld: "We are extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly. He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientation."'
p1051
aS"Collins' coach with the Celtics, Doc Rivers, drew a comparison between Monday's announcement and Jackie Robinson's role when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball."
p1052
aS'"I am extremely happy and proud of Jason Collins. He\'s a pro\'s pro. He is the consummate professional and he is one of my favorite `team\' players I have ever coached," Rivers said. "If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept. It will be society who has to learn tolerance."'
p1053
aS'Collins says he quietly made a statement for gay rights even while keeping his sexual orientation a secret. He wore No. 98 with the Celtics and Wizards -- 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, was killed, and the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization, was founded.'
p1054
aS'According to the General Social Survey, the public has grown increasingly accepting of gay relationships since the late 1980s. That survey found in 1987 that 76 percent of Americans thought sexual relations between adults of the same sex was morally wrong. That fell to 43 percent by 2012.'
p1055
aS'"I\'m glad I\'m coming out in 2013 rather than 2003. The climate has shifted; public opinion has shifted," Collins writes. "And yet we still have so much farther to go. Everyone is terrified of the unknown, but most of us don\'t want to return to a time when minorities were openly discriminated against."'
p1056
aS"While some gay athletes have talked in the past about concerns that coming out would hurt their earning potential, 12-time Grand Slam singles champion King said she thinks Collins' openness could have the opposite effect."
p1057
aS'"I have a feeling he\'s got a whole new career," King said. "I have a feeling he\'s going to make more in endorsements than he\'s ever made in his life."'
p1058
aS'Sports equipment maker Nike released a statement Monday saying: "We admire Jason\'s courage and are proud that he is a Nike athlete. Nike believes in a level playing field where an athlete\'s sexual orientation is not a consideration."'
p1059
aS'On Monday evening, hours after his story appeared on the web, Collins wrote on Twitter: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone."'
p1060
aS"Momentum has been building toward this sort of announcement from a pro athlete in a top league in the United States. NFL players Brendan Ayanbadejo and Chris Kluwe were outspoken in support of state gay-marriage amendments during last year's elections. Obama spoke about his support for gay marriage during his re-election campaign."
p1061
aS"The topic made waves during Super Bowl week when one player, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver, said he wouldn't welcome a gay member of his team. At the time, Ayanbadejo estimated that at least half of the NFL's players would agree with what Culliver said, at least privately."
p1062
aS'Scott Fujita, who recently retired after an 11-year NFL career, said: "I\'m pleased to see such an overwhelmingly positive reaction to this news, because it just shows that we\'re becoming more accepting every day. But more than anything else, I\'m happy for Jason. I\'m not a gay, closeted athlete, so I can\'t pretend to know what that must have felt like for him. But I imagine this is freeing for him, and hopefully he\'s encouraged by the millions of people who are voicing their support. ... It\'s not a reaction to some rumor and it\'s not some unwanted outing. It\'s his message, and it was delivered under his control and on his terms."'
p1063
aS"On Monday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams reiterating the league's anti-discrimination policy about sexuality. It includes a section on questions teams cannot ask prospective draft picks and free agents. After the NFL combine in February, three players said officials posed questions about sexual orientation."
p1064
aS'Earlier this month, the NHL and its players\' union partnered with an advocacy organization fighting homophobia in sports, and Commissioner Gary Bettman said the You Can Play Project underlines that "the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands."'
p1065
aS'"I would say the NHL has been a force to kind of obviously embrace and encourage. ... What (Collins) did, I think it\'s definitely (good) for basketball, and the same for hockey, too. It\'s going to be encouraging for more guys to step up and just be open about themselves," Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward said.'
p1066
aS'Living in the nation\'s capital last month while the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about same-sex marriage had an effect on Collins, who says "the strain of hiding my sexuality became almost unbearable" at that time.'
p1067
aS'"Less than three miles from my apartment, nine jurists argued about my happiness and my future. Here was my chance to be heard, and I couldn\'t say a thing," he writes. "I didn\'t want to answer questions and draw attention to myself."'
p1068
aS'After being a first-round draft pick in 2001, Collins has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds for the New Jersey Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Celtics and Wizards.'
p1069
aS'In his SI piece, he jokes self-effacingly about his journeyman career and a parlor game known as "Three Degrees of Jason Collins."'
p1070
aS'"If you\'re in the league, and I haven\'t been your teammate, I surely have been one of your teammates\' teammates. Or one of your teammates\' teammates\' teammates," he writes.'
p1071
aS'Never a star, he acknowledges, "I take charges and I foul -- that\'s been my forte. ... I set picks with my 7-foot, 255-pound body to get guys like Jason Kidd, John Wall and Paul Pierce open. I sacrifice myself for other players."'
p1072
aS'He continues: "I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: That guy is gay? But I\'ve always been an aggressive player, even in high school. Am I so physical to prove that being gay doesn\'t make you soft? Who knows? That\'s something for a psychologist to unravel."'
p1073
aS'As for what response other NBA players will have to his revelation, Collins writes: "The simple answer is, I have no idea."'
p1074
aS'"Openness may not completely disarm prejudice, but it\'s a good place to start. It all comes down to education. I\'ll sit down with any player who\'s uneasy about my coming out," he says in his account, adding: "Still, if I\'m up against an intolerant player, I\'ll set a pretty hard pick on him. And then move on."'
p1075
aS'On Monday, there was an outpouring of positive sentiments.'
p1076
aS'In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out. He was a great teammate," and rookie Bradley Beal said: "I didn\'t know about it! I don\'t think anyone did! I am proud of his decision to come out and express the way he feels and I\'m supportive of that!!"'
p1077
aS'Former teammate Jerry Stackhouse, now with the Brooklyn Nets, wrote in a text: "I hope Jason is received well by our NBA family. Jason is a friend and a former teammate that I\'ve enjoyed many laughs and conversations with and his sexual orientation won\'t change that with me. I\'ve already reached out to him personally to show support and will encourage more guys to do the same."'
p1078
aS'NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement: "Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue."'
p1079
aS"While Collins is the first male athlete in a major North American professional league to come out while intending to keep playing, several have previously spoken after they retired about being gay, including the NBA's John Amaechi, the NFL's Esera Tuaolo and Major League Baseball's Billy Bean."
p1080
aS'"I think he is immensely brave. I think it\'s a shame in this day and age he has to be immensely brave, but he is," Amaechi told the AP. "He\'s going to be a remarkable and eloquent spokesperson for what it is to be a decent, authentic human being -- never mind just for gay people."'
p1081
aS"Rick Welts, president and chief operating officer of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, is openly gay."
p1082
aS'"He probably knows what he signed up for. There\'ll be a whole bunch more television reporters and cameras than he\'s probably had in the past. ... There had been a long of speculation about when, who, how. I think that speculation has been put to rest now," Welts said, "and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first man to do this."'
p1083
aS'Collins says that if he remains in the NBA, he could face uncomfortable reactions from spectators.'
p1084
aS'"I don\'t mind if they heckle me. I\'ve been booed before. There have been times when I\'ve wanted to boo myself. But a lot of ill feelings can be cured by winning," he writes.'
p1085
aS'He adds: "I hope fans will respect me for raising my hand. And I hope teammates will remember that I\'ve never been an in-your-face kind of guy. All you need to know is that I\'m single. I see no need to delve into specifics."'
p1086
aS'In February, former U.S. soccer national team player Robbie Rogers said he was gay -- and retired at the same time. Rogers is just 25, and others have urged him to resume his career.'
p1087
aS'"I feel a movement coming," he tweeted after word of Collins\' news broke.'
p1088
aS'Female athletes have found more acceptance in coming out; Brittney Griner, a top college basketball player now headed to the WNBA, caused few ripples when she said this month she is a lesbian. Tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out decades ago, tweeted Monday that Collins is "a brave man."'
p1089
aS'"1981 was the year for me -- 2013 is the year for you," her post added.'
p1090
aS"Sports leagues in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been trying to combat anti-gay bias. But the taboo remains particularly strong in soccer, where there are no openly gay players in Europe's top leagues. Homophobic chants are still heard at some games."
p1091
aS'Soccer "is not going to change," said Amaechi, who is English and now lives in Manchester. "If it wanted to change, it would change. It has the resources to do so. It doesn\'t want to change."'
p1092
aS"Justin Fashanu is the only significant British soccer player to have come out publicly, doing so in 1990. The former Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker was found hanged in a London garage in 1998 at age 37. According to an inquest, Fashanu left a note saying that, because he was gay, he feared he wouldn't get a fair trial in the United States on sexual assault charges. Maryland police were seeking him on charges that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old boy."
p1093
aS'Among other athletes outside the U.S. to come out was Gareth Thomas, a Welsh rugby star who attracted widespread media attention in 2009 when he announced he was gay. He continued playing until retirement in 2011.'
p1094
aS'Orlando Cruz of Puerto Rico came out in October as the first openly gay professional male boxer. Canadian swimmer Mark Tewksbury came out six years after winning a gold medal in the backstroke at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Four-time Olympic diving gold medalist Greg Louganis of the U.S. revealed he was gay in 1994, a year before announcing he was also HIV-positive. Former Olympic skiing gold medalist Anja Paerson of Sweden announced last year, after retiring, that she was in a long-term relationship with a woman.'
p1095
aS"White House spokesman Jay Carney called Collins' decision courageous and said the administration views it as another example of progress and evolution in the U.S. as Americans grow more accepting of gay rights and same-sex marriage."
p1096
aS'Former President Clinton said: "Jason\'s announcement today is an important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community. It is also the straightforward statement of a good man who wants no more than what so many of us seek: to be able to be who we are; to do our work; to build families and to contribute to our communities. For so many members of the LGBT community, these simple goals remain elusive."'
p1097
aS"Collins attended Stanford with Clinton's daughter Chelsea and played in a Final Four while at the school. His twin brother, Jarron, was also a longtime NBA center who last played in the league in the 2010-11 season. Collins says he told his brother he was gay last summer."
p1098
aS'"He was downright astounded. He never suspected. So much for twin telepathy," Collins writes in SI. "But by dinner that night, he was full of brotherly love. For the first time in our lives, he wanted to step in and protect me."'
p1099
aS'Advocacy organization GLAAD released a statement from Aaron McQuade, the head of its sports program.'
p1100
aS'"Courage\' and `inspiration\' are words that get thrown around a lot in sports, but Jason Collins has given both ideas a brand new context," he said. "We hope that his future team will welcome him, and that fans of the NBA and sports in general will applaud him. We know that the NBA will proudly support him, and that countless young LGBT athletes now have a new hero."'
p1101
aS"At Stanford, Collins was a college roommate of Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. In his account, Collins writes that he realized he needed to go public when the congressman walked in Boston's gay pride parade last year -- and Collins decided he couldn't join him."
p1102
aS'"For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find. Without question or hesitation, he gives everything he\'s got to those of us lucky enough to be in his life. I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend," Kennedy said in a statement.'
p1103
aS'In Monday\'s story, Collins writes that the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?"'
p1104
aS"And now, Collins says, he will be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city's 2013 gay rights parade."
p1105
aS'"Some people insist they\'ve never met a gay person. But Three Degrees of Jason Collins dictates that no NBA player can claim that anymore. Pro basketball is a family. And pretty much every family I know has a brother, sister or cousin who\'s gay," Collins concludes. "In the brotherhood of the NBA, I just happen to be the one who\'s out."'

aS'Even amid widespread speculation that one or more male athletes would soon break the sexuality barrier \xe2\x80\x94 former Ravens safety Brendon Ayanbadejo suggested in recent interviews that one or more NFL players were preparing to come out \xe2\x80\x94 Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement stunned people around the NBA, including his Wizards teammates. Several of them said they had no inclination Collins was gay.'
p1149
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cMy first reaction was I felt for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wizards center Emeka Okafor, who said Collins, his backup, called to give him the news shortly before the article went live. \xe2\x80\x9cI was like, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to carry this around for so long.\xe2\x80\x99 I can only imagine the emotional toll that it must take, and also the strength it must take to come out. .\xe2\x80\x89.\xe2\x80\x89. Maybe more people will [come out] now. Maybe this will be the spark where other people feel comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
p1150
aS'Until recent years, the notion of an openly gay male athlete was thought to be a near-impossibility in major U.S. professional sports, where the testosterone-fueled culture of the locker room often bordered on homophobia. While celebrated female athletes such as tennis player Martina Navratilova and basketball player Sheryl Swoopes were comfortably out of the closet during their careers \xe2\x80\x94 and several male athletes revealed their homosexuality after their playing careers \xe2\x80\x94 no active male athlete could afford to take a similar step.'
p1151
aS'As recently as 2002, baseball star Mike Piazza felt compelled to call a news conference to refute rumors he was gay. In 2007, former NBA all-star guard Tim Hardaway said in a radio interview: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like gay people and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be around gay people. I am homophobic.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2011, the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 Bryant was fined $100,000 for using a homophobic slur in a rant against a referee.'

S'When Mark Madsen got a text message from Jason Collins early Monday morning asking him to call, Madsen thought the two were going to discuss graduate school options. Madsen just completed his MBA at Stanford, where both he and Collins played basketball as undergrads, and Madsen knows Collins is interested in graduate school. "He said, \'I\'m actually coming out. I\'m gay,\' " Madsen told USA TODAY Sports. "I said, \'Jason, thanks for letting me know. I got your back.\' " The two talked privately for a few minutes, Madsen said, before Collins began calling others in advance of a first-person Sports Illustrated story hitting the web. FREE AGENCY: Collins\' immediate NBA future POSITIVE REACTION: Kobe, Clinton offer support Collins will be a free agent this summer . Where he\'ll play next season, if he does, is one of many questions about the first openly gay male athlete in North American team sports while still an active player. Here are some others: Q: Why is Collins a good fit for this role? Cyd Zeigler, a manager of OutSports.com, a leading website on gay sports, has covered this issue for years. "We\'ve talked about who this person could be in the past. And Jason kind of fits the mold. A really good player who\'s been in the league for a long time who doesn\'t have a lot to lose in endorsement deals. He is set for the rest of his life financially. I never thought it was going to be a superstar." Q: Why is the timing right? Zeigler has written before that the best time for an athlete to make such an announcement would be early in an offseason. Collins\' timing "just two weeks after his regular season ended, and six months before the season starts, it couldn\'t be a better time to do this. The media will get the story out of its system before tip-off of the next season." BACKLASH: ESPN reporter calls Collins a sinner BRENNAN: Just call Jason Collins a team player Q: Are pro team sports ready to accept gay athletes in their locker rooms? Madsen said he thinks NBA locker rooms are ready: "Do you respect others, how do you treat others and how do you play? Those are the rules of the locker room. Religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation ... all those things are secondary to the goal of winning basketball games. It\'s a meritocracy in the NBA. People perform or don\'t perform." But Doug Plank, who played for the Chicago Bears in the \'70s and \'80s and coached in the NFL, said on Orlando radio this month: "Everybody tries to be politically correct ... especially people who operate in business and other public occupations. But you get inside an NFL locker room, I tell you what, it\'s something else. It\'s a jungle in there. ... Last time I was in an NFL locker room, changing clothes every day and getting ready to go out to practice, I just think that would be a very, very tough environment for someone to come forward and say they have different sexual orientation." Outside the locker room "we\'ve certainly seen so much more acceptance," Plank said. "It\'s almost normal now. It\'s not a big issue. But there are still those last bastions that are left and sports is one of them. You get into a locker room with these type of individuals that are very, very driven and very physical, and I think it\'s still an issue." VIDEO: WIZARDS OFFER STATEMENT OF SUPPORT NBA player Jason Collins came out as the first openly gay professional athlete. His team, the Washington Wizards, made a statement supporting Collins. Q: How did Collins make his announcement? Collins started his piece in SI , written with Franz Lidz, by writing: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Other excerpts: "I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different.\' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand. ... When I was younger I dated women. I even got engaged. I thought I had to live a certain way. I thought I needed to marry a woman and raise kids with her. I kept telling myself the sky was red, but I always knew it was blue." Later Monday, Collins tweeted: "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone" "Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me thru email, texts, calls, tweets, letters, and every other form of communication #support." Q: What about his twin, Jarron, who also played in the NBA? Jarron Collins also wrote a first-person piece for SI in which he said his brother told him last summer: "I won\'t lie. I had no idea. We talked, he answered my questions, I hugged him and I digested what he had told me. At the end of the day, this is what matters: He\'s my brother, he\'s a great guy, and I want him to be happy. I\'ll love him and I\'ll support him and, if necessary, I\'ll protect him." Q: Exactly what was it that ESPN\'s NBA insider Chris Broussard said on his network\'s Outside the Lines show? "Personally I don\'t believe that you can live an openly homosexual lifestyle or ... openly (engage in) premarital sex between heterosexuals. If you\'re openly living that type of lifestyle, the Bible says you know them by their fruits, it says that\'s a sin. If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ." OPEN: How leagues have prepared for a gay athlete NOTEWORTHY: Five key quotes from Collins interview Q: Charles Barkley also weighed in, on NBA TV. What did he say? "We\'ve all played with gay guys. We didn\'t treat them bad. ... For us to have an honest discussion, if guys don\'t like it, they should be able to say it and not get crucified." Q: Longtime NBA executive Rick Welts, who is now the president of the Golden State Warriors, disclosed publicly that he is gay two years ago. What was his take on Monday\'s news? "This is such a personal thing to reach the point in your life where you\'re prepared to do this. I\'m very proud of him. It\'s a very, very courageous thing that he chose to do. I read the story. It came through that it was very authentic. ... He\'s somebody who didn\'t have the benefit of somebody going before him in the same situation to learn, to watch, to see how people would react. It takes a man of great courage to do what he did today. I\'m happy for him. He\'s going to be able to be the complete Jason Collins every day for the rest of his life. "I think he probably knows what he signed up for. He\'s going to face a whole bunch more television cameras and reporters than he probably has over the course of the last couple seasons. But clearly, it\'s somebody who\'s given this a lot of thought. He\'s prepared for it and it\'s what he signed up for. There\'s been a lot of speculation about when, who, how (an athlete from any of the major sports would come out). And that speculation\'s been put to rest now and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first player to do this." PHOTOS: WHO IS JASON COLLINS? Q: Will Monday\'s news help or hurt Collins as a free agent? "I don\'t think it will hurt him," Zeigler said. "There are very few front office executives who will look at somebody and say, \'He could help us, but because he\'s gay we don\'t want him.\' There will be some executives who see a marketing opportunity." Veteran NBA executive Ed Stefanski was part of the then-New Jersey Nets front-office staff that drafted Jason Collins No. 18 in the first round in 2001. "His basketball IQ was off the chart," Stefanski said, adding he would be "very disappointed" if Collins\' announcement hurt his chances. "He has done a good job getting his weight down," Stefanski said. "But can he be athletic enough? He\'s smart enough. But can he be a third center for a team? ... A young team can use a player like him in the locker room, and a real good team can use him in spots to give guys a breather and know the team isn\'t going to fall apart when he\'s on the court." Welts is not involved in player personnel decisions, but said: "If he can convince a coach and general manager that he can play and help their team, he\'ll have another job. ... It\'ll all be what he can do on the court." Q: At what point will announcements like Monday\'s no longer be news? Zeigler: "I don\'t know at what point, whether it\'s No. 7 or 12 or 18, when the media has had enough of this story. We\'re not there yet. Gay people can\'t get married. I can\'t marry my partner of 10 years. When we have equal rights, and we\'re out and proud in every aspect of life, then I think we\'ll see that. But until then, it\'s still an issue." Q: So what\'s the big picture takeaway? "We\'re lagging behind where our society is on this issue," Welts said of men\'s pro team sports. "To some degree, we caught up a little bit today."'

If you\'re openly living that type of lifestyle, the Bible says you know them by their fruits, it says that\'s a sin. If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ."'

p1313
aS'"This is such a personal thing to reach the point in your life where you\'re prepared to do this. I\'m very proud of him. It\'s a very, very courageous thing that he chose to do. I read the story. It came through that it was very authentic. ... He\'s somebody who didn\'t have the benefit of somebody going before him in the same situation to learn, to watch, to see how people would react. It takes a man of great courage to do what he did today. I\'m happy for him. He\'s going to be able to be the complete Jason Collins every day for the rest of his life.'
p1314
aS'"I think he probably knows what he signed up for. He\'s going to face a whole bunch more television cameras and reporters than he probably has over the course of the last couple seasons. But clearly, it\'s somebody who\'s given this a lot of thought. He\'s prepared for it and it\'s what he signed up for. There\'s been a lot of speculation about when, who, how (an athlete from any of the major sports would come out). And that speculation\'s been put to rest now and we\'ll always remember that Jason Collins was the first player to do this."'

aS'"I don\'t think it will hurt him," Zeigler said. "There are very few front office executives who will look at somebody and say, \'He could help us, but because he\'s gay we don\'t want him.\' There will be some executives who see a marketing opportunity."'
p1318
aS'Veteran NBA executive Ed Stefanski was part of the then-New Jersey Nets front-office staff that drafted Jason Collins No. 18 in the first round in 2001. "His basketball IQ was off the chart," Stefanski said, adding he would be "very disappointed" if Collins\' announcement hurt his chances.'
p1319
aS'"He has done a good job getting his weight down," Stefanski said. "But can he be athletic enough? He\'s smart enough. But can he be a third center for a team? ... A young team can use a player like him in the locker room, and a real good team can use him in spots to give guys a breather and know the team isn\'t going to fall apart when he\'s on the court."'
p1320
aS'Welts is not involved in player personnel decisions, but said: "If he can convince a coach and general manager that he can play and help their team, he\'ll have another job. ... It\'ll all be what he can do on the court."'

aS"Q: At what point will announcements like Monday's no longer be news?"
p1322
aS'Zeigler: "I don\'t know at what point, whether it\'s No. 7 or 12 or 18, when the media has had enough of this story. We\'re not there yet. Gay people can\'t get married. I can\'t marry my partner of 10 years. When we have equal rights, and we\'re out and proud in every aspect of life, then I think we\'ll see that. But until then, it\'s still an issue."'
p1323
aS"Q: So what's the big picture takeaway?"
p1324
aS'"We\'re lagging behind where our society is on this issue," Welts said of men\'s pro team sports. "To some degree, we caught up a little bit today."'

S'WASHINGTON -- \n  Last summer, NBA veteran Jason Collins considered joining an old Stanford college roommate, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, at Boston\'s gay pride parade. Collins eventually decided he shouldn\'t, because he wanted to keep his secret safe: For more than a decade as a professional athlete, he had remained silent about his sexuality, worried about what teammates, opponents, fans - the world, really - might think. Then came the Boston Marathon bombings two weeks ago, which Collins says "reinforced the notion that I shouldn\'t wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" So after having, he explains, "endured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie," Collins became the first active player in one of the four major U.S. pro sports leagues to come out as gay. He wrote a first-person article posted Monday on Sports Illustrated\'s website that begins: "I\'m a 34-year-old NBA center. I\'m black. And I\'m gay." Most recently a little-used reserve center for the Washington Wizards after a midseason trade from the Boston Celtics, the 7-foot Collins is a free agent who can sign with any team. He wants to keep playing in the NBA. And he plans to be in Boston on June 8, marching alongside Kennedy at the city\'s 2013 gay pride parade. "I didn\'t doubt for a second, knowing he was gay, that he would be the one to do it," Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, told The Associated Press. "I\'ve never known him to look for publicity, or to look for the spotlight, but given that no one else would raise their hand, I knew he would do it." Added Kennedy: "I\'m so proud of him. And I\'m so proud to call him a friend." In an interview taped Monday and aired Tuesday morning, Collins told ABC\'s "Good Morning America": "I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player." His announcement Monday, nearly two weeks after the Wizards\' season ended, immediately drew praise and backing not only from pals, current and former teammates and coaches, the NBA itself, and a sponsor, but also from the White House. President Barack Obama called him - "he was incredibly supportive and he was proud of me," Collins told ABC - along with former President Bill Clinton, and athletes in various other sports. "I certainly appreciate it, as a gay person. Any time you can have someone this high-profile come out, it\'s just so helpful, particularly to young people. We\'ve reached a tipping point," said Billie Jean King, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame who won 12 Grand Slam singles titles. "We\'ve got to get rid of the shame. That\'s the main thing," King said in a telephone interview. "And Jason\'s going to help that. He\'s going to help give people courage to come out." In texts to the AP, Wizards guard Garrett Temple wrote, "I was surprised. I didn\'t know and I was right next to him in the locker room. It definitely took a lot of courage for him to come out.

S'In 12 seasons as an N.B.A. player, Jason Collins has never been an All-Star or a scoring leader or even a full-time starter, but on Monday he shattered one of the last great barriers in professional sports. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a 34-year-old N.B.A. center. I\xe2\x80\x99m black and I\xe2\x80\x99m gay,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins, who finished this season with the Washington Wizards, writes in the May 6 edition of Sports Illustrated . The magazine published the article online Monday morning. With that statement, Collins became the first openly gay male athlete who is still active in a major American team sport. Other gay athletes, including the former N.B.A. center John Amaechi, have waited until retirement to divulge their sexuality publicly. The announcement followed recent decisions by two other athletes \xe2\x80\x94 the American soccer player Robbie Rogers and the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball player Brittney Griner \xe2\x80\x94 to acknowledge that they are gay. When Rogers, 25, revealed last month that he was gay, he also said he was retiring from soccer. (He has since indicated he may play again.) Griner, the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, will soon embark on her professional career. Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was greeted with an outpouring of support from teammates, league executives and major National Basketball Association stars, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade among them. \xe2\x80\x9cProud of @jasoncollins34,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant, the Los Angeles Lakers star, wrote on his Twitter account. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others.\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant added two hashtags: \xe2\x80\x9ccourage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csupport.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of the league\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names followed suit, including the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 Steve Nash, Oklahoma City\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Durant, the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 Jason Kidd and San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Parker. Several teams sent out statements of support. Prominent coaches, including Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Doc Rivers, who has worked with Collins, gave support in interviews. However, one National Football League player, Mike Wallace of the Miami Dolphins, posted a comment on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cAll these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys.\xe2\x80\x9d He later deleted the comment and issued an apology. And on ESPN, the N.B.A. analyst Chris Broussard, citing his religious beliefs, said that living openly as a homosexual was a sin and that doing so was \xe2\x80\x9cwalking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d But those comments were greatly outweighed by the supportive ones Collins received, particularly from his N.B.A. peers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe overwhelming positive reaction does not surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cOur players are actually knowledgeable and sophisticated on this issue, and our teams understand it completely. I would have expected them to be supportive, and they are.\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama called Collins \xe2\x80\x9cto express his support and said he was impressed by his courage,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a Twitter post from the White House. Michelle Obama, on her account, called Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement \xe2\x80\x9ca huge step forward for our country.\xe2\x80\x9d Collins becomes a free agent July 1 and intends to pursue another contract, which might be viewed as a truer test for how N.B.A. teams deal with a gay athlete. However, complicating that question is the fact that Collins, at 34, is a marginal player with limited skills, more valued for his locker-room presence than his play and not at the top of anyone\xe2\x80\x99s list of players to sign. He appeared in just 38 games this season, which he split between the Boston Celtics and the Wizards, and was used sparingly. Collins was never among the most skilled centers to begin with, instead relying on his size (7 feet, 255 pounds), intelligence and work ethic to carve out a niche after being drafted 18th over all in 2001. In his Sports Illustrated essay, Collins alludes to his future in the league: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve reached that enviable state in life in which I can do pretty much what I want. And what I want is to continue to play basketball. I still love the game, and I still have something to offer. My coaches and teammates recognize that. At the same time, I want to be genuine and authentic and truthful.\xe2\x80\x9d One N.B.A. scout estimated that Collins had a 25 percent chance of making an opening-night roster next season, based solely on his basketball skills. But a general manager for another team predicted that Collins would be back in the league because of his reputation as a solid teammate and leader. That general manager said that Collins\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure of his sexuality could even appeal to a forward-thinking owner. Dave Kopay, who came out as gay in 1975 after a nine-year N.F.L. career, said on Monday he had waited nearly 40 years for this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he did is not easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kopay said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m overwhelmed with how he\xe2\x80\x99s done this. I\xe2\x80\x99m so, so happy right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi, who announced that he was gay after a five-year N.B.A. career, called Collins\xe2\x80\x99s public declaration \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly groundbreaking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe are unusually blessed to have such an eloquent spokesman,\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi said in a phone interview from England, where he lives. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say \xe2\x80\x98we,\xe2\x80\x99 I mean society, as opposed to just gay people. Anybody who has ever interviewed Jason knows he is not just your average athlete. He\xe2\x80\x99s cerebral, thoughtful, kind \xe2\x80\x94 so many things that many athletes are not enough of. Add this authentic declaration on top of things, it makes him one of the perfect role models for our young people.\xe2\x80\x9d Amaechi was among several gay-rights advocates who said it mattered whether Collins played next season. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s not on a team, he\xe2\x80\x99s just another guy who did it at the end of his career, and he retired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim Buzinski, a co-founder of Outsports, a Web site devoted to gays and sports. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil we see him walking onto a court, in either a starting lineup or in a backup role off the bench, and there\xe2\x80\x99s that anticipation that Jason Collins is going to step on the floor \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to matter as much until that moment. That\xe2\x80\x99s what everyone is waiting for.\xe2\x80\x9d Until now, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s only public hint of his orientation was a subtle one. He wore No. 98 for the Celtics and the Wizards, in honor of Matthew Shepard, the gay University of Wyoming student who was killed in 1998. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number has great significance to the gay community,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins wrote. Collins informed his Wizards teammates, as well as Stern, in a series of phone calls Monday morning, before the story was published online. One Wizards teammate, Emeka Okafor, said that if Collins returned to Washington, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome him back with open arms.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s still the same guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Okafor said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just let us know more about him.\xe2\x80\x9d Collins grew up in the Los Angeles suburbs and played college basketball at Stanford. As a professional, Collins has averaged a modest 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds a game while playing for six teams. He spent most of his first seven seasons with the Nets, helping them reach the finals in 2002 and 2003. But Collins kept his sexuality deeply hidden. In an accompanying essay in Sports Illustrated, Collins\xe2\x80\x99s twin brother, Jarron \xe2\x80\x94 a former N.B.A. center who now scouts for the Los Angeles Clippers \xe2\x80\x94 wrote that he \xe2\x80\x9chad no idea\xe2\x80\x9d that Jason was gay until Jason told him last summer. Collins\xe2\x80\x99s announcement also surprised his closest friends, including Mark Madsen, who played three years with Collins at Stanford and another season in the N.B.A., with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Madsen was among the people Collins called Monday morning. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say one of Jason\xe2\x80\x99s amazing characteristics is he has always been unafraid to express his opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d Madsen said in a telephone interview, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be afraid of anything, really.\xe2\x80\x9d The Nets\xe2\x80\x99 Jerry Stackhouse said that Collins, his teammate for one season in Atlanta, was the perfect individual \xe2\x80\x9cto carry the flag for other players.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Jason\xe2\x80\x99s been in the league for 12 years and has had so many different teammates, he\xe2\x80\x99s got people to vouch for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stackhouse said. All of the major sports leagues have been preparing, to various degrees, for the moment when an active player comes out. The N.F.L., amid speculation that a handful of players were preparing to make the move en masse, has been working with gay advocacy groups to smooth the way for acceptance. The National Hockey League also recently announced a comprehensive program for training and counseling on gay issues for its teams and players.

S'Jason Collins, who played with the NBA\'s Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards this season, has disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly gay male athlete in the four major American pro team sports. The center, who said he is now a free agent, made the disclosure in a column appearing in the upcoming issue of Sports Illustrated . "I didn\'t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I\'m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn\'t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, \'I\'m different.\' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I\'m raising my hand," he wrote. Collins also wrote that the killing of three people at the Boston Marathon persuaded him to make an announcement. Things can change in a moment, so why not start living more truthfully, he wrote. On Twitter, Collins thanked everyone who sent him messages of support. "All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I\'m not walking it alone," he wrote . Sports Illustrated\'s managing editor said Collins was reticent about being a flag bearer. Spike Lee slams the Collins hate machine "It is a much simpler, more personal reason. He wants to have a family," Chris Stone told CNN. "He wants the same life that his twin brother, Jarron, has. This is a secret he\'s kept for a very long time. He didn\'t even inform his brother that he was gay until late last summer. ... So much for twin telepathy." Jarron, who played in the NBA for 10 seasons and was Jason\'s teammate at Stanford, tweeted to his brother: "Very proud of you." "Jason Collins has forever changed the face of sports," said the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group fighting for gay rights. It likened the announcement to Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play in major league baseball in the modern era. NBA\'s first openly gay player "At a time when millions are reflecting on the life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, Jason Collins is a hero for our own times," the group said. Former NBA player Charles Barkley, now an analyst for "Inside the NBA" on TNT, told CNN on Monday night that active players shouldn\'t be surprised that a teammate is gay. "I think anybody who thinks they never played with a gay player is an idiot," he said on "AC360." "I played with several gay players. It\'s their own business, and I think they should get to be who they want to be." Collins is a 7-footer who has played with six NBA teams -- the Wizards, Celtics, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Memphis Grizzlies and New Jersey Nets -- over the past 12 seasons. He has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 713 career games, and he has had a great deal of playoff experience with the Nets (who have since moved to Brooklyn) and the Hawks. Momentum had been growing in recent months for an active player in the National Football League, National Hockey League, National Basketball Association or Major League Baseball to come out. Just a few weeks ago, the NHL announced a new program teaching tolerance and giving support to gay athletes. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the agreement made the NHL\'s policy of inclusiveness "clear and unequivocal." "While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community, we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture with the NHL Players\' Association that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands," Bettman said in the joint statement with You Can Play. And NFL player Brendon Ayanbadejo, The New York Times reported, has been in contact with closeted players in several sports. "What we\'re trying to facilitate is to get them together and do what they want to do, do what is right for them," he told the Times. Collins paves way for gay athletes In February, former professional soccer player Robbie Rogers announced on his blog that he is gay. His former U.S. teammates showed solidarity in response to the news. Though reaction to Collins\' announcement also was overwhelming support, not everyone had a positive response. ESPN basketball analyst Chris Broussard said the Bible calls homosexuality a sin. "If you\'re openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that\'s walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ," he said. NFL receiver Mike Wallace tweeted Monday: "All these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys SMH." He tweeted again, saying he was being misinterpreted. "Never said anything was right or wrong I just said I don\'t understand!! Deeply sorry for anyone that I offended," he wrote. The Dolphins, Wallace\'s employer, issued a statement saying the team has spoken with Wallace about the tweets. The team said it will address its policy of inclusion with all of its players. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Collins, a 34-year-old veteran, is widely respected in the league. "We are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue," he said in a statement. Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said the team is "extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly." "He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientations," Grunfeld said. Boston Celtics head coach Doc Rivers called Collins "a pro\'s pro" and one of his favorite players he ever coached. "If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept," Rivers said. "It will be society who has to learn tolerance." Bill Clinton called the announcement an "important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community." Clintons welcome announcement from friend Jason Collins Collins, who had been traded by the Celtics to the Wizards this season, wrote in his essay that U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, helped prompt his decision to come out as gay. Kennedy and Collins were roommates at Stanford. He recounts hearing about Kennedy, who is not gay, marching in Boston\'s Gay Pride Parade. "For as long as I\'ve known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find," Kennedy said. "I\'m proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend." President Barack Obama called Collins "to express his support and said he was impressed by his courage," a White House official said. Active players posted their approval on Twitter. The Los Angeles Lakers\' Kobe Bryant said: "Proud of @jasoncollins34. Don\'t suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others." Steve Nash, also a Laker, said: "The time has come. Maximum respect." Two Wizards players, Garrett Temple and Bradley Beal, said in tweets they were "proud" of Collins. "Much respect to my teammate," Temple said. "Great teammate, mentor and better person," said Beal. Collins\' announcement comes after the end of the Wizards\' season, and he is no longer under contract. He is an "old" player by NBA standards who has never been a star. So will he play in the NBA this fall? ESPN.com said only six of 14 team officials reached for an unofficial poll Monday thought he would be back in the league. If he does return, he probably will play only a few minutes a game for a team that needs a veteran leader, the other executives told ESPN.com. Twitter reacts to the revelation Some male athletes have come out as gay after they\'ve left professional sports. One is John Amaechi, a former NBA player. Amaechi told CNN he hopes Collins will be a catalyst for a wider acceptance of openly gay athletes, saying he believes Collins is better equipped than anyone who came before him to handle the attention that will come his way. But it may take more, Amaechi said. People like to believe one iconic figure can change things, he said, "but the reality is that when there\'s this tipping point, or enough people coming together deciding that change is necessary, that\'s when change happens." The Women\'s National Basketball Association, the women\'s pro league, has had its share of milestones and openness as far as gays are concerned. In 2005, Sheryl Swoopes, a top player in the WNBA, announced she was gay. Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in this year\'s WNBA draft, recently said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that she is gay. Griner finished her college career as the NCAA\'s all-time leading shot-blocker with 748 and as the No. 2 all-time scorer with 3,283 points. Opinion: Openly gay player is not a distraction'
