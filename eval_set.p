S'But numerous questions remain about the origins of the chemical and what effect its apparent use could have on the ongoing Syrian civil war and international involvement in it. When asked whether the intelligence community\'s conclusion pushed the situation across President Barack Obama\'s "red line" that could trigger more U.S. involvement in the war, Hagel said it\'s too soon to say. "We need all the facts. We need all the information," he said. "What I\'ve just given you is what our intelligence community has said they know. As I also said, they are still assessing, and they are still looking at what happened, who was responsible and the other specifics that we\'ll need." In a letter sent to lawmakers before Hagel\'s announcement, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded "with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin." The White House cautioned that the "chain of custody" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime. Read the letter to Sen. Carl Levin (PDF) But, the letter said, "we do believe that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very likely have originated with the Assad regime." The Syrian government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years, bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance. The United Nations estimated in February that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began. Caution urged The Obama administration said it is working to gather more information on the reports and is calling for a full-scale United Nations investigation into what may have happened. "Given the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient -- only credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making," the letter said. What\'s next in Syria State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. is working with its allies to get to the bottom of what may have happened. He said the intelligence assessments were "not the final corroborative facts we\'re looking for." "We want the highest possible level of confidence because of the seriousness of the matter," he said. Lawmakers call for action After the announcement, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the United States needs to take action, but offered different proposals for what the next steps should be. "It is clear that \'red lines\' have been crossed and action must be taken to prevent larger-scale use," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement. "Syria has the ability to kill tens of thousands with its chemical weapons. The world must come together to prevent this by unified action which results in the secure containment of Syria\'s significant stockpile of chemical weapons." Rep. Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the U.S. government -- which currently supplies "nonlethal aid" to Syrian rebels -- must start "to immediately arm vetted elements of the Syrian opposition." Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, urged the administration to work for the establishment of a safe zone for Syrian rebels. "Everything that the non-interventionists said would happen in Syria if we intervened has happened," he said. "The jihadists are on the ascendency, there is chemical weapons being used, the massacres continue. "The president of the United States said that if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons that it would be a game changer, that it would cross a red line," the Arizona senator said. "I think it is pretty obvious that red line has been crossed." Later, McCain said the reported use of chemical weapons was only a matter of time and that the United States "should have intervened a long time ago whether Bashar al-Assad was using them or not." "No one should be surprised that he would do such a thing. We all know he will do whatever\'s necessary to hang on to power," McCain told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on Thursday. "And why should, frankly, chemical weapons be a red line when he\'s slaughtering and massacring, raping and torturing, his own people?" Searching for e vidence The White House letter, signed by legislative affairs director Miguel Rodriguez, indicates that the assessment is based "in part on physiological samples." On Wednesday, Syrian Free Army leader Gen. Salim Idriss told CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in several places, including Homs, Aleppo and Otaiba, near Damascus. Idriss said rebel forces had some of the people reportedly exposed to chemical weapons examined by doctors, and they took soil and blood samples. "And the samples were tested, it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons," he said. The British Foreign Office said Thursday that it had "limited but persuasive" evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, and it urged al-Assad to allow unfettered access for international investigators. Ventrell told reporters on Thursday that allowing a team of U.N. experts to investigate would be the "most direct way" to find out what happened. "We have the U.N. ready to deploy inspectors on a couple of days notice. We\'re already pre-deploying out in the field near Syria and ready to go in," he said. "And you have the regime resisting a full and thorough and credible investigation within Syria. So we urge the regime to allow these inspectors in. That currently is the most direct route to getting to the bottom of what may have occurred." Read the letter to McCain (PDF) NATO leaders discus s the issue The administration disclosure comes two days after Secretary of State John Kerry urged NATO members to prepare for the possible use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, while Russia\'s foreign minister accused the West of politicizing the search for such weapons, comparing it to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday that reports of chemical weapons in Syria must be carefully investigated to avoid a repetition of the "Iraqi scenario" in which unconfirmed allegations that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction were the basis for the U.S.-led invasion. He accused Western nations of trying to "politicize the issue" and broadening the investigation. Experts were supposed to be sent to Syria to study the possible use of chemical weapons in Aleppo. Instead, Lavrov said, investigators demanded access to all facilities in Syria and the right to interview all Syrian citizens. "I believe that is too much," he said. NATO remains conflicted about Syria\'s two-year civil war. While members are concerned about the mounting causalities, millions of refugees and the potential for a wider regional spillover, they are loath to become embroiled in another Middle Eastern conflict. Israeli evidence Earlier this week an Israeli intelligence official said Damascus was using weapons banned under international law against its own people in the country\'s civil war. On Wednesday, Israeli President Shimon Peres said that he expected the United States to fall in line with its estimate on chemical weapons use in Syria. "I think the United States and us and others will do whatever we can to meet this very dangerous weapon," he said. "The sooner the better." Syria has said it is rebels who have used chemical weapons.

S'WASHINGTON (AP) \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Syria \'s stockpile of chemical weapons could be a greater threat after that nation\'s president leaves power and could end up targeting Americans at home, lawmakers warned Sunday as they considered a U.S. response that stops short of sending military forces there. U.S. officials last week declared that the Syrian government probably had used chemical weapons twice in March, newly provocative acts in the 2-year civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The U.S. assessment followed similar conclusions from Britain, France, Israel and Qatar \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d key allies eager for a more aggressive response to the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama has said Syria\'s likely action \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d or the transfer of President Bashar Assad \'s stockpiles to terrorists \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d would cross a "red line" that would compel the United States to act. Lawmakers sought to remind viewers on Sunday news programs of Obama\'s declaration while discouraging a U.S. foothold on the ground there. "The president has laid down the line, and it can\'t be a dotted line. It can\'t be anything other than a red line," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich. "And more than just Syria, Iran is paying attention to this. North Korea is paying attention to this." Added Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Ga.: "For America to sit on the sidelines and do nothing is a huge mistake." Obama has insisted that any use of chemical weapons would change his thinking about the United States \' role in Syria but said he didn\'t have enough information to order aggressive action. "For the Syrian government to utilize chemical weapons on its people crosses a line that will change my calculus and how the United States approaches these issues," Obama said Friday. But Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, said Sunday the United States needs to consider those weapons. She said that when Assad leaves power, his opponents could have access to those weapons or they could fall into the hands of U.S. enemies. "The day after Assad is the day that these chemical weapons could be at risk ... (and) we could be in bigger, even bigger trouble," she said. Both sides of the civil war already accuse each other of using the chemical weapons. The deadliest such alleged attack was in the Khan al-Assal village in the Aleppo province in March. The Syrian government called for the United Nations to investigate alleged chemical weapons use by rebels in the attack that killed 31 people. Syria, however, has not allowed a team of experts into the country because it wants the investigation limited to the single Khan al-Assal incident, while U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged "immediate and unfettered access" for an expanded investigation. One of Obama\'s chief antagonists on Syria, Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., said the United States should go to Syria as part of an international force to safeguard the chemical weapons. But McCain added that he is not advocating sending ground troops to the nation. "The worst thing the United States could do right now is put boots on the ground on Syria. That would turn the people against us," McCain said. His friend, Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., also said the United States could safeguard the weapons without a ground force. But he cautioned the weapons must be protected for fear that Americans could be targeted. Raising the specter of the lethal bomb at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Graham said the next attack on U.S. soil could employ weapons that were once part of Assad\'s arsenal. "Chemical weapons \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d enough to kill millions of people \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d are going to be compromised and fall into the wrong hands, and the next bomb that goes off in America may not have nails and glass in it," he said. Rogers and Schakowsky spoke to ABC\'s "This Week." Chambliss and Graham were interviewed on CBS\'s "Face the Nation." McCain appeared on NBC\'s "Meet the Press." ___ Follow Philip Elliott on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Philip_Elliott'

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The White House said Thursday that it believes the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in its civil war, an assessment that could test President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s repeated warnings that such an attack could precipitate American intervention in Syria . The White House, in a letter to Congressional leaders, said the nation\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies assessed \xe2\x80\x9cwith varying degrees of confidence\xe2\x80\x9d that the government of President Bashar al-Assad had used the chemical agent sarin on a small scale. But it said more conclusive evidence was needed before Mr. Obama would take action, referring obliquely to both the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s use of faulty intelligence in the march to war in Iraq and the ramifications of any decision to enter another conflict in the Middle East. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the agencies actually expressed more certainty about the use of these weapons than the White House indicated in its letter. She said Thursday that they voiced medium to high confidence in their assessment, which officials said was based on the testing of soil samples and blood drawn from people who had been wounded. American officials said the attacks, which occurred last month in a village near Aleppo and in the outskirts of Damascus , had not been definitively connected to Mr. Assad. The White House said the \xe2\x80\x9cchain of custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the weapons was not clear, raising questions about whether the attacks were deliberate or accidental. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said in the letter, which was signed by its legislative director, Miguel E. Rodriguez. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making.\xe2\x80\x9d That meticulously legal language did not disguise a thorny political and foreign policy problem for Mr. Obama: he has long resisted the calls to arm the Syrian rebels and has expressed deep doubts about the wisdom of intervening in an Arab nation so riven with sectarian strife, although he has also issued pointed warnings to Syria. In a statement last summer, Mr. Obama did not offer a technical definition of his \xe2\x80\x9cred line\xe2\x80\x9d for taking action, but said it was when \xe2\x80\x9cwe start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized.\xe2\x80\x9d In Jerusalem last month, he said proof that Syria had used such weapons would be a \xe2\x80\x9cgame changer\xe2\x80\x9d for American involvement . The Pentagon, administration officials said, has prepared the president a menu of options that include commando raids that would secure chemical weapons stockpiles and strikes on Syrian planes from American ships in the Mediterranean. Last year, the United States secretly sent a 150-member task force to Jordan to help deal with the possibility that Syria would lose control of its stockpiles. Mr. Obama could also provide more robust aid to the rebels, including weapons. White House officials gave no indication of what Mr. Obama might do, except to say that any American action would be taken in concert with its allies. While lawmakers from both parties swiftly declared that the president\xe2\x80\x99s red line had been breached, they differed on what he should do about it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe political reality is that he put himself in that position that if the \xe2\x80\x98red line\xe2\x80\x99 is crossed \xe2\x80\x94 he made it very clear \xe2\x80\x94 it would change his behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said. The intelligence \xe2\x80\x9cis a compelling argument for the president to take the measures that a lot of us have been arguing for all along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The timing of the White House disclosure also suggested the pressures it is facing. It came the same day that the British government said that it had \xe2\x80\x9climited but persuasive\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of the use of chemical weapons, and two days after an Israeli military intelligence official asserted that Syria had repeatedly used chemical weapons. In a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, several weeks ago calling for a United Nations investigation, Britain laid out evidence of the attacks in Aleppo and near Damascus as well as an earlier one in Homs. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, reported that dozens of victims were treated at hospitals for shortness of breath, convulsions and dilation of the pupils, common symptoms of exposure to chemical warfare agents. Doctors reported eye irritation and fatigue after close exposure to the patients. Citing its links to contacts in the Syrian opposition, Britain said there were reports of 15 deaths in the suburban Damascus attack and up to 10 in Aleppo, where the government and rebels have each accused the other of using chemical weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately the deaths have not been high,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Feinstein said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there have been deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d The United States has also pushed for a United Nations investigation, but it made clear on Thursday that it has collected enough evidence on its own and with Britain and other countries to make its assessment. An official said the United States was also suspicious about the attack in Homs. While several officials said the intelligence agencies expressed medium to high confidence about its overall assessment, two intelligence officials noted that there were components of the assessment about which the agencies were less certain. They did not offer details. Administration officials had begun the week casting doubt on the claims made by the Israeli official, Brig. Gen. Itai Brun, about chemical weapons. \xe2\x80\x9cSuspicions are one thing; evidence is another,\xe2\x80\x9d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday on a visit to Egypt. But by then, a senior administration official said, the intelligence agencies had already become more confident of their assessment, after several weeks of examining the evidence. With Secretary of State John Kerry scheduled to brief senators on Syria on Thursday, the White House decided on Wednesday evening to get ahead of that meeting. The administration\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure came in a response to Mr. McCain, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the committee\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, who wrote to the White House asking whether Mr. Assad or his supporters had used chemical weapons during the two-year-long war. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the fact that we have been developing additional information within our intelligence community,\xe2\x80\x9d a White House official said to reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cwe felt it was the right and prudent thing to do to respond in an unclassified form to this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d Lawmakers generally welcomed the White House\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure, though some suggested that the administration was still inclined to play down the implications of the assessment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that we read the intelligence as it is laid out, not as we would like it to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.'

S'ANTAKYA, Turkey \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d Syrian activists have lashed out at signs the U.S. remains reluctant to intervene in the country\'s civil war despite growing evidence President Bashar al-Assad\'s forces have used chemical weapons against his people. "I hope there will be a reaction from America, but I don\'t think there will be," said Bassam al Ahmed, 31, a Kurdish human rights activist from Qamishli in Syria. "(But) if the U.N. and the U.S. don\'t take any action of any kind, the Syrian regime will only have more time, and it would be a green light for the regime to use chemical weapons in the future." The Obama administration said Thursday it could say with "varying degrees of confidence" that chemical weapons, including sarin gas, had been used at least twice by Syrian government forces on separate occasions in suburban Damascus and Aleppo. In the Syrian capital however, a government official said Assad\'s military "did not and will not use chemical weapons even if it had them." He instead accused opposition forces of using them in a March attack on the village of Khan al-Assad outside of the northern city of Aleppo. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements. Syrian rebel groups including the Syrian Network for Human Rights \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d which told USA TODAY on Thursday they had amassed evidence including videos, photos and eyewitness testimony that showed the weapons had been used in 10 separate locations in the war-torn country \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d called for a Western military-enforced no-fly zone and heavier artillery, such as rocket launchers. But even though President Obama had said the regime\'s use of chemical weapons would be the "red line" for the U.S., White House officials said the revelation would not lead to immediate intervention. Instead they called for further U.N. investigation to "credibly evaluate the evidence and establish what took place". "Clearly there appears to be circumstantial evidence that that has taken place," said David Hartwell, a Middle East analyst at IHS Jane, defense and security analysts in London. "The alleged low-level usage sarin leaves open the possibility that it may not have occurred in terms of Syrian government complicity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d it could be a rogue unit." "From that point of view, I think the administration has plenty of latitude to say, hold on a second, we didn\'t mean that would immediately trigger intervention," he added. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said in an interview with the BBC that he supported Obama on the principle of the use of chemical weapons as a "red line" and added they were looking for ways to "put pressure on the regime so we can bring it to an end." "We need to go on gathering this evidence and also to send a very clear warning to the Syrian regime about these appalling actions," he said. Activists reacted with anger. "If you take the examples of Iraq and Syria, you can conclude only one thing: unless there is a strong financial incentive, the international community doesn\'t intervene anywhere," said U.K.-based Syrian activist Abdulwahab Omar. "In Iraq they acted because of a suspicion there were weapons of mass destruction, but there was a financial incentive. In Syria, there is a piling amount of evidence of crimes against humanity, but no financial incentive," he said. While western governments attempt to gather more evidence, activists said they hoped the U.S. would act soon. "The USA never thought the Syrian government would use chemical weapons, and the red line was to buy them time not to react; it was just an excuse," said Nour Hameedo, 25, from the Idlib province in Syria, talking from Antakya. "I don\'t think that anyone will react in the international community, if they wanted to, they would have done something earlier," he said. Contributing: Charles McPhedran and Jennifer Collins.'

S"BEIRUT \xe2\x80\x94 Last week\xe2\x80\x99s allegations from top U.S. officials that Syrian forces probably deployed chemical weapons against rebels come amid an array of disputed\xc2\xa0 reports about purported chemical attacks in Syria. There have been at least three incidents \xe2\x80\x94 all unconfirmed \xe2\x80\x94 in which reports surfaced publicly that chemical weapons had been deployed in Syria, either by the government or rebels. All have been relatively small scale considering the fact that agents such as sarin can cause mass casualties. It's not clear which, if any, of the incidents are involved in the U.S. allegations against Syria. The most high-profile of the incidents allegedly occurred on March 19 in the town of Khan al Asal, outside the northern city of Aleppo. The government said 25 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded in a poison-gas assault. The government and the opposition exchanged blame for the attack, a pattern of cross-accusations that has recurred repeatedly following mass killings in Syria. But accounts from both sides agreed that the casualties occurred after a rocket strike and included both civilians and an unspecified number of regime troops. The Syrian government said \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d based in a nearby area launched a rocket at 7:30 a.m. containing \xe2\x80\x9cchemical materials.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The rocket struck about 300 yards from a Syrian army post, the state press agency said. The opposition countered that the Syrian military fired a chemical-tipped Scud missile. According to the official account, the casualties resulted from both the explosion and the gases unleashed upon impact. It was never clear how many of the victims succumbed to the alleged gas. Official video and photographs said to be from a hospital in Aleppo showed purported victims breathing through oxygen masks. The substance caused \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate fainting, convulsion and death,\xe2\x80\x9d the Syrian information minister, Omran Zoubi, told reporters. The government suggested that rebels may have armed a missile with a chlorine derivative looted from an Aleppo factory. Chlorine, widely used as a water purifier and in other industrial applications, was deployed on a large scale as a chemical weapon almost a century ago in the trenches of World War I. Some accounts of the March 19 attack\xc2\xa0 indicated that the odor of chlorine was noticeable at the site. Experts interviewed after the attack generally said that the casualty numbers would have been much higher if the missile had been armed with a nerve agent like sarin, which is believed to be in the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal. After the attack, Syrian officials alleged that the opposition used a laboratory in adjoining Turkey to fabricate the toxic material. The aim, according to Syrian officials, was to create a false-flag scenario in which the Syrian military was accused of deploying chemical weapons \xe2\x80\x94 thus triggering international intervention . The Syrian government reportedly took soil samples from the site and blood samples from victims to be used in any\xc2\xa0 United Nations investigation. As the March incident caused an international uproar, the opposition charged that the government had also fired chemical weapons on the same day in the disputed township of Otaybah, east of Damascus, the capital. Details about that alleged attack have remained sketchy, though rebels say the strike caused both deaths and injuries. The opposition has since alleged several other incidents involving chemical gas attacks. The first flurry of allegations about chemical weapons use in Syria involved an incident late last year in the heavily contested central city of Homs. On its website, Foreign Policy magazine in January cited a secret State Department cable that concluded, after an extensive consular investigation, that Syrian authorities probably deployed chemical weapons on Dec. 23 in Homs. However, the U.S. State Department later categorically distanced itself from the report, which it said was based on \xe2\x80\x9canecdotal\xe2\x80\x9d information.\xc2\xa0 State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington on Jan. 16 that investigators \xe2\x80\x9cfound no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used\xe2\x80\x9d last December in Homs. When the U.S. charged last week that it appeared Syria had used sarin gas in unspecified attacks, the Syrian government denounced the allegations as a \xe2\x80\x9cbare-faced lie.\xe2\x80\x9d A top Russian diplomat warned in a visit to Lebanon this weekend that the charges should not be used as an \xe2\x80\x9cpretext\xe2\x80\x9d for an Iraq-style intervention in Syria, Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s long-time ally. Still, the explosive\xc2\xa0 accusations raised\xc2\xa0 the specter that Damascus may have crossed the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cred line\xe2\x80\x9d for possible stepped-up\xc2\xa0 intervention in the conflict, which has been going on for more than two years. U.S. officials conceded that the proof of two reported instances of the nerve agent was not conclusive, and the \xe2\x80\x9cchain of custody\xe2\x80\x9d of the substances was unclear. Experts say it is almost impossible to make an accurate determination without access to the impacted site and laboratory examinations of samples of soil, blood, urine or human tissue. The evidence that has emerged publicly so far appears to involve photographs of purported victims and alleged traces of toxins found in individuals and possibly in soil. A planned United Nations\xc2\xa0 inquiry remains stalled amid differences between the U.N. and the Syrian government about how much access the investigators will have in the country.

aS'The government and the opposition exchanged blame for the attack, a pattern of cross-accusations that has recurred repeatedly following mass killings in Syria.

p395
aS'The government suggested that rebels may have armed a missile with a chlorine derivative looted from an Aleppo factory. Chlorine, widely used as a water purifier and in other industrial applications, was deployed on a large scale as a chemical weapon almost a century ago in the trenches of World War I. Some accounts of the March 19 attack\xc2\xa0 indicated that the odor of chlorine was noticeable at the site.'

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 The government is moving the morning-after pill over the counter but only those 15 and older can buy it -- an attempt to find middle ground just days before a court-imposed deadline to lift all age restrictions on the emergency contraceptive. Today, Plan B One-Step is sold behind pharmacy counters, and buyers must prove they\'re 17 or older to buy it without a prescription. Tuesday\'s decision by the Food and Drug Administration lowers the age limit and will allow the pill to sit on drugstore shelves next to spermicides or other women\'s health products and condoms -- but anyone who wants to buy it must prove their age at the cash register. Some contraceptive advocates called the move promising. "This decision is a step in the right direction for increased access to a product that is a safe and effective method of preventing unintended pregnancies," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. "It\'s also a decision that moves us closer to these critical availability decisions being based on science, not politics." But earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman of New York blasted the Obama administration for imposing the age-17 limit, saying it had let election-year politics trump science and was making it hard for women of any age to obtain the emergency contraception in time. He ordered an end to the age restrictions by Monday. The women\'s group that sued over the age limits said Tuesday\'s action is not enough, and it will continue the court fight. Lowering the age limit "may reduce delays for some young women but it does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. The FDA said the Plan B One-Step will be packaged with a product code that prompts the cashier to verify a customer\'s age. Anyone who can\'t provide such proof as a driver\'s license, birth certificate or passport wouldn\'t be allowed to complete the purchase. "These are daunting and sometimes insurmountable hoops women are forced to jump through in time-sensitive circumstances, and we will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women," Northup said. Half the nation\'s pregnancies every year are unintended, and doctors\' groups say more access to morning-after pills could cut those numbers. The pills contain higher doses of regular contraceptives, and if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 percent. The FDA had been poised to lift all age limits and let Plan B sell over-the-counter in late 2011, when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in an unprecedented move, overruled her own scientists. Sebelius said some girls as young as 11 are physically capable of bearing children, but shouldn\'t be able to buy the pregnancy-preventing pill on their own. President Barack Obama supported Sebelius\' move and a spokesman said earlier this month that the president\'s position hadn\'t changed. The FDA said Tuesday\'s decision was independent of the court case. Instead, after the Obama administration\'s 2011 action, Plan B maker Teva Women\'s Health had filed a new application with the age-15 compromise.'

S'This move comes just weeks after a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, ordered the FDA to make the morning-after birth control pill available to women of any age, without a prescription. Tuesday\'s FDA announcement, which pertains to an application from Teva Women\'s Health, Inc., is not related to that, the FDA said. "The FDA\'s approval of Teva\'s current application for Plan B One-Step is independent of that litigation and this decision is not intended to address the judge\'s ruling," the FDA said in a statement. In early April, the U.S. Justice Department indicated an appeal of the Brooklyn judge\'s order was under consideration. "The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly," department spokeswoman Allison Price said. According to the new FDA decision, Plan B One-Step will now be labeled to reflect that proof of age is required to purchase it, and it cannot be sold where age cannot be verified. The packaging will include a product code that prompts the cashier to ask and verify the age of the customer. The product will be available in retail outlets with pharmacies, but the pill can be sold during non-pharmacy hours, too. "While we fully support this expansion of access to birth control, we continue to believe that the administration should lift all unnecessary restrictions to emergency contraception, consistent with the prevailing science and medicine," Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said Tuesday in a statement. The FDA decision does not pertain to the two other emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the United States. Plan B is available from generic manufacturers over-the-counter for women 17 and older and Ella is available by prescription only, for all ages, and prevents pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. "Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States," said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement. "The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease." None of these products protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Controversy surrounding emergency contraception in the United States has lasted more than just one morning. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States. Opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug. In 2011, Teva Women\'s Health Inc., maker of Plan B One-Step, had asked the FDA to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA\'s recommendation in 2011, saying, "I do not believe enough data were presented to support the application." She mandated requiring a prescription for girls under 17. In early April, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman said in his order , "The decisions of the Secretary with respect to Plan B One-Step and that of the FDA with respect to the Citizen Petition, which it had no choice but to deny, were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable." Korman\'s order sparked praise among supporters of the morning-after pill for all ages, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had launched a relevant lawsuit. Nancy Northup, the center\'s president and CEO, said in a statement about that order: "This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods." But other groups, including the Family Research Council, expressed concerns about Korman\'s order. "There is a real danger that Plan B may be given to young girls, under coercion or without their consent. The involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls. However, today\'s ruling removes these common-sense protections," Anna Higgins, director of the organization\'s Center for Human Dignity, said in a statement. The FDA approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in Plan B is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary, or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm. If there has been fertilization, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus, the morning-after pill will not work. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. A 2012 study in the journal Pediatrics found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception, including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription, and who can take it in general. The morning-after pill goes for about $50, said Susannah Baruch, interim president and CEO of Reproductive Health Technologies Project.'

aS'The FDA decision does not pertain to the two other emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the United States.

aS'In early April, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman said in his order , "The decisions of the Secretary with respect to Plan B One-Step and that of the FDA with respect to the Citizen Petition, which it had no choice but to deny, were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable."'

aS"Korman's order sparked praise among supporters of the morning-after pill for all ages, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had launched a relevant lawsuit."
p517
aS'Nancy Northup, the center\'s president and CEO, said in a statement about that order: "This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods."'

aS'"There is a real danger that Plan B may be given to young girls, under coercion or without their consent.

S'The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it would make the most widely known morning-after pill available without a prescription to girls and women ages 15 and older, and also make the pill available on drugstore shelves, instead of keeping it locked up behind pharmacy counters. Until this decision the pill, Plan B One-Step, which is used after sexual intercourse to help prevent pregnancy , was available without a prescription only for ages 17 and older. The decision did not address a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in early April that gave the drug agency 30 days to make the pill available for all ages without a prescription. In a scathing opinion handed down three weeks ago, Judge Edward R. Korman in the Eastern District of New York said the Obama administration had put politics before science in restricting access to the drug. The F.D.A. and the White House said Tuesday that the Department of Justice was still deciding whether to appeal the ruling, something it can do independently of the drug agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision on Tuesday. That decision, which takes effect immediately, represents a compromise on the politically charged issue of access to emergency contraception , which has pitted conservative and anti- abortion groups against advocates for women\xe2\x80\x99s health and reproductive rights. The Justice Department is most likely weighing not only the substance of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, but also the precedent the ruling would set in countermanding an order by a White House cabinet member, Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services. In 2011, she decided the pill would be available without prescription only to those 17 and older, despite the F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s finding that it was safe and effective and should be available without any age restrictions. She said the pill had not been studied for safety in girls as young as 11. It was the first time the F.D.A. had been publicly overruled by a cabinet secretary. After her order, the pill\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer submitted an amended application seeking access for 15-year-olds. On Tuesday, a Health and Human Services Department official said that Ms. Sebelius was comfortable with the F.D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s decision to approve that application. Besides lowering the age restriction, the new rule addresses concerns of women who were unable to get the pill if their drugstore\xe2\x80\x99s pharmacy counter happened to be closed. Now, Plan B One-Step will be available in drugstore aisles where family planning or women\xe2\x80\x99s health products are displayed. The packaging will include a product code that, when scanned by a cashier, will indicate that the customer\xe2\x80\x99s proof of age is required. To try to prevent theft, the manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, has arranged for each box to have a security tag, the drug agency said. Margaret A. Hamburg, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement that data proved that 15-year-olds \xe2\x80\x9cwere able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease .\xe2\x80\x9d The agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision applies only to Plan B One-Step, which is a one-pill dose, not to the two-pill generic versions, because there is not enough data to show the two-dose versions can be used responsibly by younger teenagers without the intervention of a health provider, said an F.D.A. spokeswoman, Erica Jefferson. Marty Berndt, a vice president and general manager for Teva, called the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9ca significant milestone for women.\xe2\x80\x9d But it did not completely satisfy either side of the emergency contraception debate.

S'The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Plan B One-Step for women aged 15 and older without a prescription. The decision, which was announced on Tuesday , was in regards to an amended application submitted by Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. The company first sought approval to market Plan B One-Step to all females of reproductive age, but changed their initial appeal for approval for those 15 and older. Play Video Plan B One-Step, also known as the "morning after pill," is a form of emergency contraception that can reduce the chance of pregnancy after a person has engaged in unprotected sex, meaning they did not use another form of birth control or their chosen method did not work. There are currently three types of emergency contraception available for sale in the U.S.: Plan B One-Step, Plan B, and ella. Plan B is a two-pill system that requires a prescription for those who are under 17. Ella also requires a prescription, regardless of age. Plan B One-Step does not stop pregnancy if a woman is already pregnant, nor has any scientific evidence shown that it will harm a fetus that already exists. The single-dose pill works best if taken within three days after sexual intercourse. "Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States," Dr. FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, said in a press release. "The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease." Plan B One-Step will now bear a label that reads "not for sale to those under 15 years of age *proof of age required* not for sale where age cannot be verified." The product code will prompt cashiers to ask for proof of age when a person attempts to purchase the product, and it will not be sold to anyone who cannot provide proof of their age. Security tags will also be placed on the products to deter thieves. Plan B One-Step will be sold in retail outlets with an onsite pharmacy as part of the agreement, but it can be sold regardless if the pharmacy is open or not. The FDA considered actual use studies and label comprehension data submitted by Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. when making their decision. The agency determined that women 15 and older knew the product could not be used regularly and would not protect them from sexually transmitted diseases. Earlier in April 2013, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered that the FDA had to make contraceptives available to females of all ages, calling the requirement for a prescription "arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable." However, the pending request from Teva Women\'s Health, Inc. at that time only asked for the prescription ban to be lifted for women aged 15 or older. "This decision is a step in the right direction for increased access to a product that is a safe and effective method of preventing unintended pregnancies," Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement to CBS News. "It\'s also a decision that moves us closer to these critical availability decisions being based on science, not politics.

The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it was approving Plan B One-Step, also known as the morning-after pill, to be sold in the retail aisle next to other over-the-counter medications. Customers will not have to ask a pharmacist for it. FDA officials say the announcement is unrelated to a federal judge\'s order earlier this month, which gave the agency 30 days to make the pill available to all girls and women without a prescription, regardless of age. Until now, women have had to ask a pharmacist for emergency contraception. Those under 17 could get the pill only with a prescription. In his April 5th ruling,U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman noted that emergency contraception has been shown to be extremely safe, and that the FDA\'s age limits were arbitrary. "FDA has engaged in intolerable delays," Korman said, amounting to an "administration agency filibuster." Korman\'s ruling was in response to a lawsuit by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to expand access to emergency contraception, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within three days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Plan B One-Step, a single pill containing a hormone found in birth control pills, sold by Teva Women\'s Health, does not terminate an existing pregnancy and does not harm a developing fetus, the FDA said. About half of pregnancies are unintended, studies show. FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said the Tuesday approval "is independent of the judge\'s ruling and is not intended to address it." In an interview with USA TODAY\'s Editorial Board last week, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the agency had not yet decided how to respond to the judge\'s order. Jefferson said the Department of Justice handles litigation, and said all questions about the judge\'s order should be referred to that agency. Now, customers will be able to buy Plan B One-Step just as they would purchase condoms. But girls will have to show an ID to prove their age, the FDA said. "The FDA is under a federal court order that makes it crystal clear that emergency contraception must be made available over the counter, without restriction to women of all ages by next Monday," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. "Lowering the age restriction to 15 for over-the-counter access to Plan B One-Step may reduce delays for some young women \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but it does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification or after the pharmacy gates have been closed for the night or weekend. These are daunting and sometimes insurmountable hoops women are forced to jump through in time-sensitive circumstances, and we will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women." Emergency contraception has had a long history with the FDA. The drug was first approved in 1993. In 2011, the FDA was about to approve an application from its manufacturer, Teva Women\'s Health, to sell it over the counter. President Obama expressed concerns, however, and Secretary of Health and Human Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA. When its application to sell Plan B One-Step over-the-counter without age restrictions was rejected, Teva submitted a new application, requesting approval for those 15 and up, the FDA said. That application, asking for approval for those 15 and up, was filed before the judge\'s ruling, Jefferson said. At the time of the judge\'s ruling, the Family Research Council\'s Anna Higgins said, "Making Plan B available for girls under the age of 17 without a prescription flies in the face of medical information and sound judgment." Higgins also expressed concern that the over-the-counter availability of Plan B for girls of any age would put many at further risk of sexually transmitted infections. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America officials praised the FDA\'s decision, although the group also encouraged the FDA to lift all restrictions on emergency contraception, as mandated by the court. "While there are still practical questions to resolve, this is an important step forward to expand access to emergency contraception and for preventing unintended pregnancy," Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said. " This decision will eliminate some of the biggest barriers and hurdles that women face in getting emergency contraception when they need it, which means many more women will be able to prevent unintended pregnancy." Other forms of emergency contraception have been approved. A two-dose version of Plan B is available generically and available to women 17 and up without a prescription. It requires a prescription for girls under age 17. Another version, sold as Ella, is sold only with a prescription and is approved to prevent pregnancy within five days of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.'

S'The suspect, a 35-year-old Dutch citizen, traveled around Spain in a van he used as a mobile office, Spain\'s National Police said in a statement Sunday. Police arrested him Thursday north of Barcelona, Spain, on a European arrest warrant at the request of judicial authorities in the Netherlands, the statement said. Authorities have not released his name, and a photo police issued showing his detention blurred his face. The arrest comes a month after Internet users around the globe faced slowed-down service during the prolonged denial-of-service assault on The Spamhaus Project , a European spam-fighting group. Security experts said the attack used more sophisticated techniques than most distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks and targeted the Web\'s infrastructure, which led to other sites performing slowly. In a DDoS attack, computers flood a website with requests, overwhelming its servers and causing it to crash or become inaccessible for many users. Last month\'s attack appears to be part of a fierce feud between organizations that monitor spam and try to block it and companies that accuse spam blockers of unjustly blacklisting them. The Spamhaus Project is a nonprofit that patrols the Internet for spammers and publishes a list of Web servers those spammers use. Matthew Prince, CEO of Internet security firm CloudFlare, estimates the group may be responsible for up to 80% of all spam that gets blocked. And last month, the group added a new name to its blacklist, CyberBunker, and said spammers use the company as a host to spray junk mail across the Web. During his arrest, the suspect told authorities he was a diplomat and "minister of telecommunications and foreign relations of the Republic of CyberBunker," police said Sunday. Last month CyberBunker -- a Dutch company housed in a former NATO nuclear bunker -- did not take credit for the attack against Spamhaus but didn\'t shy away from talking about it. "This here is the Internet community puking out Spamhaus," Sven Olaf Kamphuis of CyberBunker told CNN in March. "We\'ve had it with the guys. ... What we see right here is the Internet puking out a cancer." Kamphuis and other critics say that Spamhaus oversteps its bounds and has essentially destroyed innocent websites in its spam-fighting efforts. "Spamhaus itself is a more urgent danger" than spam, Kamphuis told CNN. "Pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down and then they get it shut down without any court order. That is a significantly larger threat to internet and freedom of speech and net neutrality than anything else." In a statement Friday, Spamhaus thanked Dutch authorities for last week\'s arrest. "Spamhaus will resolutely continue its mission to provide reliable protection against cyberthreats such as spam, malware and botnets and work with Internet service providers and organizations worldwide to create a safer Internet," the organization said in a statement.'

S'A Dutchman thought to be associated with the "biggest cyberattack\n in history" last month reportedly has been arrested in Spain. The Dutch justice ministry announced on its\n  website today (April 26) that a 35-year-old Dutchman,\n  identified only by the initials SK, had been detained on a\n  European warrant yesterday (April 25) in the Barcelona area. The ministry\'s press release said SK was suspected in "severe"\n \n distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the\n anti-spam organization Spamhaus and Spamhaus partners in the\n Netherlands, the United States and Britain. During the \n week-long series of attacks on Spamhaus , Sven Olaf Kamphuis,\n a Dutchman in his mid-30s, emerged as the spokesman for Stophaus,\n the group leading the attacks, which at one point reached an\n unprecedented 300 gigabits per second. After the New York Times published an article saying the attacks\n were causing "widespread congestion and jamming crucial\n infrastructure around the world," Kamphuis disappeared from view.\n (The congestion was felt primarily in the London area, northern\n Germany and the Netherlands.) Security researcher Brian Krebs noted that Kamphuis\' Facebook\n  account said he was a native of Amsterdam living in Barcelona.\n  The last posting on the account was on Wednesday (April 24). [ How\n DDoS Attacks Threaten the Internet ] In March, Kamphuis portrayed himself to various media outlets as\n one of the founders of CyberBunker, a Dutch Web-hosting service\n that proudly proclaims it will take any customers except\n terrorists or child pornographers. CyberBunker, named for the nuclear-blast-proof NATO bunker it\n purports to house its servers in, has a lot of unsavory clients,\n including accused cybercriminals, spammers and peddlers of fake\n pharmaceuticals. Subsequent reports have said CyberBunker moved out of the bunker\n years ago. Krebs said CyberBunker\'s official "WHOIS" listing puts\n the company in Antarctica. Because of its nasty clients, Spamhaus put CyberBunker\'s range of\n Internet addresses on its email and Web blacklists, which are\n used by many Internet service providers worldwide to weed out\n spam and unsavory material. Kamphuis and Stophaus complained that Spamhaus\' efforts were\n illegal and declared that if Spamhaus would block its clients,\n its clients would blockade Spamhaus with DDoS attacks, bombarding\n Spamhaus and its own ISPs with huge amounts of useless Internet\n traffic.

S'A Dutch citizen suspected of involvement in what experts describe as the biggest cyberattack in the history of the Internet has been arrested. THE HAGUE, Netherlands\xc2\xa0\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d A Dutch citizen has been arrested in Spain in connection with what experts described as the biggest cyberattack in the history of the Internet,\xc2\xa0launched against an anti-spam watchdog group last month, prosecutors announced Friday. The Netherlands National Prosecution Office said a 35-year-old suspect it identified only by his initials, S.K., was arrested Thursday at his home in Barcelona. Authorities also seized computers and mobile phones. Dutch prosecutors do not release full names of suspects, in line with privacy laws. According to a prosecution statement, the man is suspected of "unprecedentedly serious attacks on the non-profit organization Spamhaus." He was held on a European arrest warrant and is expected to be extradited to the Netherlands to face justice. The so-called denial-of-service attack on Spamhaus fired a torrent of data at the organization\'s servers and was blamed for other disruptions online. Dutch banks and an electronic payment service also have been hit by similar attacks in recent weeks, but prosecutors say they do not believe they are linked to the Spamhaus incident. Spamhaus, a site responsible for keeping ads for counterfeit Viagra and bogus weight-loss pills out of the world\'s inboxes, said it apparently was targeted by groups angry at being blacklisted by the Swiss-British group. Prosecutors said the cyberattack also hit "partners" of Spamhaus in the United States, the Netherlands and Britain. At the time, Vincent Hanna, a researcher with Spamhaus, called it a "small miracle" the organization had remained online during the cyber onslaught.

S'On-time performance of airlines at the nation\'s biggest airports dropped 9 percentage points Monday after hundreds of air traffic controllers were furloughed by budget cuts. East Coast airports felt most of the pain, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Staff shortages at air traffic towers were expected to cause more delays Tuesday in Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas. "Travelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather-related issues," the agency said in a statement. Frustrated lawmakers in Washington criticized FAA administrators, saying budget cuts resulting from the so-called sequester could have been made without furloughing air traffic controllers. "Not all government spending is created equally, and so this morning I\'m calling on the Obama administration and the FAA to be smarter and more transparent about the sequester," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor. The union representing the nation\'s 15,000 air traffic controllers said the overtime the FAA is paying to deal with the staff shortages is erasing any savings from the furloughs. "It\'s simple math \xe2\x80\x94 furloughing controllers earning base while paying others base pay plus an additional 50% will not result in savings," the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. said in a statement.

S'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 The furlough of air traffic controllers delayed more than 1,200 flights on Monday, the first weekday of the unpaid leaves, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday as lawmakers criticized the agency for how it was handling the automatic budget cuts. Apart from the furloughs, the F.A.A. counted more than 1,400 delays for weather and other reasons. On Tuesday, it said there were delays in the New York area and in Washington because of \xe2\x80\x9cstaffing challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d but it did not say what fraction of the delays were due to furloughs. \xe2\x80\x9cTravelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather-related issues,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency said in a statement. The staffing problems are mostly in radar rooms, not control towers, it added. There are 30,000 to 35,000 commercial flights a day in the United States. Some travelers were delayed a few minutes, but others missed connections and were delayed for hours. Some later flights were delayed or canceled because the airplanes they were to use had arrived so late. FlightStats.com , a company that monitors airline performance, counted nearly 7,000 delays on Monday, from all causes. A company spokeswoman, Sarena Regazzoni, said that the number \xe2\x80\x9cseems heightened but not excessive.\xe2\x80\x9d Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the ranking Republican member, sent a letter to the transportation secretary, seeking more information and complaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthe administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to our inquiries has consistently been slow and disturbingly limited.\xe2\x80\x9d The two senators said that the F.A.A. administrator, Michael P. Huerta, had provided \xe2\x80\x9conly general statements\xe2\x80\x9d to the committee about how it would handle budget cuts resulting from the so-called sequester, while giving a detailed briefing to the airlines. The airlines, though, complained that their briefing was cursory. Airline officials said that the F.A.A. had passed out copies of an analysis of likely delays, but then demanded all the copies back. (In a news briefing last week, Mr. Huerta and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood displayed a complicated slide showing the projected impact at a variety of airports, but did not give out copies or post it on the Web, as is their usual practice.) But those complaining about the cuts have not specified just where the F.A.A. should find the more than $600 million it says it must wring out of the system. The air traffic controllers\xe2\x80\x99 union, whose members are facing 11 unpaid days between now and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, on Tuesday described the delays so far as \xe2\x80\x9cjust the beginning of what promises to be a huge economic disruption if the furloughs are not stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe F.A.A. has been forced to cancel all training, halt work on critical modernization and NextGen projects, and are even using overtime at some of the busiest facilities,\xe2\x80\x9d the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. NextGen is a satellite-based system that is supposed to raise air traffic capacity and cut delays. Using overtime \xe2\x80\x9cis actually costing the F.A.A. money, eliminating any savings that are supposedly being achieved for sequestration,\xe2\x80\x9d the union said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s simple math \xe2\x80\x94 furloughing controllers earning base while paying others base pay plus an additional 50 percent will not result in savings.\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, held a news briefing to urge the F.A.A. to delay the furloughs.

S'Sequestration became a reality to the broad public in airports across the country this week, and on Friday both Congress and the White House caved in to pressure from tens of thousands of airline passengers angered by flight delays. The lawmakers and the Obama administration, creators of the across-the-board funding cuts, found a path around their own creation, approving legislation to end the daily furloughs of 1,500 air traffic controllers that caused long delays at several major airports. The House voted 361 to 41 Friday in favor of a bill that had won unanimous support in the Senate, and White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Obama would sign it. With Congress headed home for a week, the question becomes whether lawmakers will return emboldened to keep tinkering with sequestration, giving more federal agencies the flexibility to make required budget cuts in ways that do not call for furloughs or unpopular service cuts. The White House had pushed for Congress to eliminate sequestration, but its hand was forced Friday. Now, it faces the risk that if Congress continues to mandate small spending changes that reduce the high-profile and painful consequences of the cuts, the entire sequestration process will become more palatable to the public. House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) hinted at that possibility after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s vote. \xe2\x80\x9cThis legislation ensures beyond a shadow of a doubt that the agency now has more than enough capacity to end air traffic controller furloughs, stop the pain for the traveling public and protect the economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Shuster said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout giving the FAA any additional funding.\xe2\x80\x9d The Federal Aviation Administration furloughs may have been the most visible effect of the $85 billion in spending cuts that kicked in across the government on March 1 after a gridlocked Congress failed to reach agreement on a broad plan to reduce the federal deficit. The cuts had been designed to be so painful and indiscriminate \xe2\x80\x94 mindless, even \xe2\x80\x94 that even a partisan Congress would not allow them to happen. Republicans see the changes in FAA spending ordered by the new legislation as a model for future adjustments to the cuts. They are pushing legislation to give the administration more flexibility to administer the sequester while leaving in place the overall spending reductions the law requires. But the White House, which seemed taken by surprise by the bill\xe2\x80\x99s swift passage, resumed the push to end sequestration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is that this is just a Band-Aid solution,\xe2\x80\x9d Carney said. \xe2\x80\x9cCongress should do the responsible thing and stop dealing with these issues from crisis to crisis, and simply engage in a discussion about how we can eliminate the sequester entirely through balanced deficit reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d The furlough of 1,500 air traffic controllers each day to achieve $200\xc2\xa0million in savings from the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s budget became a test of wills between Congress and the administration.

S"A week after federal officials launched job furloughs at air traffic control towers, the controllers are back on a regular work schedule -- and airline delays are now caused primarily by severe weather. The number of delays over the week averaged about 5,800 per day, according to a report from Flightstats.com, a website that monitors flight delays. The greatest number of delays came last Monday, April 22, when slightly more than 7,000 flights were delayed, according to Flightstats. On Sunday, the nation's airports reported 4,800 delays, according to the website. By Monday morning, the only significant delays reported were attributed to heavy cloud cover at Philadelphia International Airport. To cut about $636 million from its budget, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered air traffic controllers to take one day off of work for every two-week period, reducing its workforce by about 10%. The furloughs caused takeoff delays of hundreds of planes when congestion in the skies grew heavy. The airports that endured the most delays were LaGuardia, Newark Liberty, Los Angeles International, John F. Kennedy and O'Hare International. A bill approved by the House on Friday and sent to the president allowed the FAA to transfer $253 million from infrastructure improvement funds to put furloughed air traffic controllers back to work. Senate officials said the bill also prevented closures at 149 control towers, many in rural areas, that rely on contract air controllers.

S'Facing the prospect of at least another week of widespread flight delays, the House on Friday passed legislation to ease up the sequester\'s impact on the Federal Aviation Administration. The measure passed, and now goes to President Obama for his signature, in spite of grumblings from Democrats that Congress is alleviating the impact of sequestration on America\'s powerful air travelers while failing to address the strain it has had on programs like Meals on Wheels, Head Start and federal unemployment insurance. "We ought not to be mitigating the sequester\'s effect on just one segment when children, the sick, the military and many other groups" are ignored, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said on the House floor. "Let\'s deal with all the adverse consequences of sequester." The House passed the bill by a vote of 361 to 41, granting the FAA authority to use up to $253 million from various accounts to avoid reduced staffing and operations through Sept. 30. Because of the sequester -- the $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts that went into effect in March -- the FAA on Sunday began furloughs of 47,000 employees, leading to flight significant delays. The bill passed Friday should avert those furloughs, as well as the closures of small airport towers. Congress faced pressure to act on the matter this week, before it leaves for a week-long recess. The Senate passed the legislation by unanimous consent late Thursday night after after hours of intense, closed-door negotiations. Obama administration officials participated in the talks, even though Mr. Obama has said he wants to replace the sequester with a comprehensive plan for deficit reduction that includes both new tax revenues and spending cuts. "The president believes it\'s good news to eliminate this problem," White House Spokesman Jay Carney said Friday as the House was voting on the bill. However, he added, Mr. Obama "believes this is a band-aid covering a massive wound to the economy" In response to a disappointing economic report released by the Commerce Department Friday, Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted that the sequestration is slowing down the economic recovery. "These arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation\'s future competitiveness," he wrote in a White House blog post. "The Administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work, like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing." The GOP-led House has passed legislation to replace the sequester with other spending cuts, but they\'ve resisted the Democrats\' call for a "balanced approach" that would replace it with spending cuts and tax reforms. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., sent a letter to House Republicans Friday morning casting the FAA bill as a "victory" over the Democrats\' call for more tax revenues. "Consider that the Democrats opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases," he wrote. "By the first of this week Senator Reid proposed replacing the whole sequester with phony war savings. And by last night, Senate Democrats were adopting our targeted "cut this, not that" approach.

S'A bill that would end the Federal Aviation Administration\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s furlough on air traffic controllers is now on its way to President Obama to sign. On Friday, the House passed the measure 361-41. \xc2\xa0 On Thursday night, the Senate passed the legislation after most lawmakers had left the Capitol for a weeklong vacation.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, lawmakers from both parties urged the Obama administration to postpone or cancel the furlough of air traffic controllers, with some accusing the FAA of playing politics as the cuts contributed to massive delays at airports across the country. The furloughs went into effect Sunday, and the impact was felt almost immediately. The FAA reported more than 1,200 delays due to the sequester-tied cuts on Monday. On Tuesday, the agency reported "challenges" at airports in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. On Wednesday, the FAA said there had been close to 900 flights delayed \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93attributable to staffing reductions resulting from the furlough.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd The FAA claims the furloughs were unavoidable. But lawmakers say the agency could find the money elsewhere, by cutting spending on consultants and grant programs and in other areas.\xc2\xa0 Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a key participant in the Senate-side talks, said the legislation would "prevent what otherwise would have been intolerable delays in the air travel system, inconveniencing travelers and hurting the economy." Senate approval followed several hours of pressure-filled, closed-door negotiations, and came after most senators had departed the Capitol on the assumption that the talks had fallen short Officials said a small group of senators insisted on a last-ditch effort at an agreement before Congress adjourned for a vacation that could have become politically problematic if the flight delays continued. "I want to do it right now. There are other senators you\'d have to ask what the hang-up is," Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said at a point when it appeared no compromise would emerge. For the White House and Senate Democrats, the discussions on legislation relating to one relatively small slice of the $85 billion in spending cuts marked a shift in position in a long-running struggle with Republicans over budget issues. Similarly, the turn of events marked at least modest vindication of a decision by the House GOP last winter to finesse some budget struggles in order to focus public attention on the across-the-board cuts in hopes they would gain leverage over Obama. The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a union that represents FAA employees, reported a number of incidents it said were due to the furloughs. In one case, it said several flights headed for Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York were diverted on Wednesday when a piece of equipment failed. "While the policy for this equipment is immediate restoral, due to sequestration and furloughs it was changed to next-day restoral," the union said. It added it was "learning of additional impacts nationwide, including open watches, increased restoration times, delays resulting from insufficient funding for parts and equipment, modernization delays, missed or deferred preventative maintenance, and reduced redundancy." The airlines, too, had Congress to restore the FAA to full staffing. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xc2\xa0'
