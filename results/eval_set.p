S' In a letter sent to lawmakers before Hagel\'s announcement, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded "with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin.'
p11
aS'" The White House cautioned that the "chain of custody" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime.'
p12
aS'Read the letter to Sen. Carl Levin (PDF) But, the letter said, "we do believe that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very likely have originated with the Assad regime.'
p13
aS'" The Syrian government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years, bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance.'
p14
aS'The United Nations estimated in February that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began.'
p15
aS'Caution urged The Obama administration said it is working to gather more information on the reports and is calling for a full-scale United Nations investigation into what may have happened.'
p16
aS'"Given the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient -- only credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making," the letter said.'
p17
aS"What's next in Syria State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. is working with its allies to get to the bottom of what may have happened."
p18
aS'He said the intelligence assessments were "not the final corroborative facts we\'re looking for.'
p19
aS'" "We want the highest possible level of confidence because of the seriousness of the matter," he said.'

aS'Lawmakers call for action After the announcement, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the United States needs to take action, but offered different proposals for what the next steps should be.'
p21
aS'"It is clear that \'red lines\' have been crossed and action must be taken to prevent larger-scale use," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement.'
p22
aS'"Syria has the ability to kill tens of thousands with its chemical weapons.'
p23
aS"The world must come together to prevent this by unified action which results in the secure containment of Syria's significant stockpile of chemical weapons."
p24
aS'" Rep. Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the U.S. government -- which currently supplies "nonlethal aid" to Syrian rebels -- must start "to immediately arm vetted elements of the Syrian opposition.'
p25
aS'" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, urged the administration to work for the establishment of a safe zone for Syrian rebels.'
p26
aS'"Everything that the non-interventionists said would happen in Syria if we intervened has happened," he said.'
p27
aS'"The jihadists are on the ascendency, there is chemical weapons being used, the massacres continue.'
p28
aS'"The president of the United States said that if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons that it would be a game changer, that it would cross a red line," the Arizona senator said.'
p29
aS'"I think it is pretty obvious that red line has been crossed.'
p30
aS'" Later, McCain said the reported use of chemical weapons was only a matter of time and that the United States "should have intervened a long time ago whether Bashar al-Assad was using them or not.'
p31
aS'" "No one should be surprised that he would do such a thing.'
p32
aS'We all know he will do whatever\'s necessary to hang on to power," McCain told CNN\'s Jake Tapper on Thursday.'

p37
aS'"And the samples were tested, it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons," he said.'
p38
aS'The British Foreign Office said Thursday that it had "limited but persuasive" evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, and it urged al-Assad to allow unfettered access for international investigators.'
p39
aS'Ventrell told reporters on Thursday that allowing a team of U.N. experts to investigate would be the "most direct way" to find out what happened.'
p40
aS'"We have the U.N. ready to deploy inspectors on a couple of days notice.'
p41
aS'We\'re already pre-deploying out in the field near Syria and ready to go in," he said.'
p42
aS'"And you have the regime resisting a full and thorough and credible investigation within Syria.'

p46
aS'Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday that reports of chemical weapons in Syria must be carefully investigated to avoid a repetition of the "Iraqi scenario" in which unconfirmed allegations that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction were the basis for the U.S.-led invasion.'

All have been relatively small scale considering the fact that agents such as sarin can cause mass casualties. It's not clear which, if any, of the incidents are involved in the U.S. allegations against Syria."
p382
aS'The most high-profile of the incidents allegedly occurred on March 19 in the town of Khan al Asal, outside the northern city of Aleppo. The government said 25 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded in a poison-gas assault.'
p383
aS'The government and the opposition exchanged blame for the attack, a pattern of cross-accusations that has recurred repeatedly following mass killings in Syria. But accounts from both sides agreed that the casualties occurred after a rocket strike and included both civilians and an unspecified number of regime troops.'
p384
aS'The Syrian government said \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d based in a nearby area launched a rocket at 7:30 a.m. containing \xe2\x80\x9cchemical materials.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The rocket struck about 300 yards from a Syrian army post, the state press agency said.'
p385
aS'The opposition countered that the Syrian military fired a chemical-tipped Scud missile.'
p386
aS'According to the official account, the casualties resulted from both the explosion and the gases unleashed upon impact. It was never clear how many of the victims succumbed to the alleged gas.'
p387
aS'Official video and photographs said to be from a hospital in Aleppo showed purported victims breathing through oxygen masks. The substance caused \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate fainting, convulsion and death,\xe2\x80\x9d the Syrian information minister, Omran Zoubi, told reporters.'
p388
aS'The government suggested that rebels may have armed a missile with a chlorine derivative looted from an Aleppo factory. Chlorine, widely used as a water purifier and in other industrial applications, was deployed on a large scale as a chemical weapon almost a century ago in the trenches of World War I. Some accounts of the March 19 attack\xc2\xa0 indicated that the odor of chlorine was noticeable at the site.'
p389
aS'Experts interviewed after the attack generally said that the casualty numbers would have been much higher if the missile had been armed with a nerve agent like sarin, which is believed to be in the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal.'
p390
aS'After the attack, Syrian officials alleged that the opposition used a laboratory in adjoining Turkey to fabricate the toxic material. The aim, according to Syrian officials, was to create a false-flag scenario in which the Syrian military was accused of deploying chemical weapons \xe2\x80\x94 thus triggering international intervention .'
p391
aS'The Syrian government reportedly took soil samples from the site and blood samples from victims to be used in any\xc2\xa0 United Nations investigation.'
p392
aS'As the March incident caused an international uproar, the opposition charged that the government had also fired chemical weapons on the same day in the disputed township of Otaybah, east of Damascus, the capital. Details about that alleged attack have remained sketchy, though rebels say the strike caused both deaths and injuries. The opposition has since alleged several other incidents involving chemical gas attacks.'

aS'"Not all government spending is created equally, and so this morning I\'m calling on the Obama administration and the FAA to be smarter and more transparent about the sequester," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor.'
p923
aS"The union representing the nation's 15,000 air traffic controllers said the overtime the FAA is paying to deal with the staff shortages is erasing any savings from the furloughs."
p924
aS'"It\'s simple math \xe2\x80\x94 furloughing controllers earning base while paying others base pay plus an additional 50% will not result in savings," the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. said in a statement.'
p925
aS'But FAA officials said they were only approving overtime pay on a limited basis.'
p926
aS"The on-time rate for airlines at the nation's largest airports dropped to an average of about 73% on Monday, compared with 82% the previous Monday, according to Flightstats, a website that monitors airline performance rates."
p927
aS'On-time rates dropped even more at airports in New York and Florida, with LaGuardia Airport reporting a 47% rate and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport at 51%, according to the website. Some delays in New York, however, were attributed to strong winds.'
p928
aS'At Los Angeles International Airport, where some travelers reported delays of up to an hour, the average on-time performance was 78% on Monday, about the same rate as the previous Monday, according to Flightstats.'
p929
aS'The FAA said it delayed 1,200 flights Monday because of staff shortages \xe2\x80\x94 about three times as many as Sunday. The FAA attributed 1,400 other delays to severe weather and other factors, such as airport maintenance work.'
